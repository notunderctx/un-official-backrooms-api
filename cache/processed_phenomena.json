    "description": "<p><strong>Addendum:</strong><br/>\nThe following is an excerpt of a discussion held with a Despair type affected individual, regarding the nature of the controlling force. Although much of the discussion yielded little information, this excerpt is considered a possible insight into how individuals are affected by Directed Control.</p><br><p>\u201cDid you ever learn how to drive? When you were a kid, you had an idea of what that meant; you could understand stoplights, signs, what a steering wheel and pedals were. Maybe you heard your parents complain about bad drivers from time to time, but you never really had a concept of what that meant. And then you learned how to drive. You noticed people who don\u2019t use their turn signals, people who roll through stop signs, people who drive a little too far to one side of the lane. Getting cut off, hitting the brakes to avoid a collision someone else almost caused, all of a sudden you see all of the bad and dangerous driving on the road that you never noticed before, as a kid sitting in the back. You can\u2019t un-see it. Once you notice, you\u2019ll always notice.</p><br><p>And now, you can see through the cracks and holes of the moist, moldy, disintegrating, yellow walls. The damp of the Backrooms has weakened its walls, broken it down in some places. You saw something through those holes. And you always will, now that you know that there is indeed something on the other side.\u201d</p><br><p><br/></p><br><p>The creator of this proposal (user:SICKLE) has requested feedback:</p><br><p>Okay, just to be clear, I was joking about the \u201ctell me it sucks\u201d thing. Be, like, normal about feedback, yeah? Don\u2019t be fucking rude, and all.</p><br><p><a href=\"https://www.wikidot.com/account/messages#/new/1382994\" target=\"_blank\">&gt; Open suggested edit submission form.</a></p><br><p>No god here, just <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/ghostchibi\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(1382994); return false;\"><img alt=\"ghostchibi\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=1382994&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334080\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=1382994)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/ghostchibi\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(1382994); return false;\">ghostchibi</a></span> and an <a href=\"/ghostchibi\">author page</a>.</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/phenomenon-1\">Phenomenon 1</a>\" by ghostchibi, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

Blood runs through a level to oxygenate those who belong and eliminate those who don\u2019t. The floods will cleanse the world of those who don\u2019t submit to the unbound.</p><br><p><strong>Blood Moons</strong> are a mysterious phenomenon that can happen on any level where sound and vision are present. This means <strong>Blood Moons</strong> cannot appear on Level 6 and other levels similar. This phenomenon is a rare level-wide phenomenon that causes no physical damage but causes any form of organic matter caught inside it to disappear.</p><br><p>A Blood Moon occurring at an unknown level taken by an M.E.G explorer. The explorer had managed to seek shelter before the flood began.</p><br><p>A Blood Moon on an outdoor level will start with the sky turning red. Conversely, all lights will glow a bright red on an indoor level. Whenever a Blood Moon begins, each wanderer will experience extreme stress and panic. The sound of rushing water will soon follow. Wherever the wanderer is, it will always seem that this sound is getting closer to them. If a wanderer has not reached the higher ground or found a closed-off space, they will soon be erased or drowned depending on the category of Blood Moon. Flooding is the final and most dangerous aspect of a Blood Moon. 5 minutes after the Blood Moon starts, blood will flood the entire space. This blood is estimated to be ten feet (3 meters) in depth at all points. Strangely, when tested, the DNA of this blood matches the DNA of the person testing it, varying in who sees it. The results will show up differently for everyone who observes them.</p><br><p>Once the flood ends, it will always result in the disappearance of any organic object from the level caught in the flood, and the rest of the level is entirely unscathed.</p><br><p>Blood Moons have three distinguishable types. They can be grouped into three categories.</p><br><p>Category A is the most common Blood Moon. It floods a level and causes all organic matter to be completely erased if caught by the flooding. The blood appears to be the usual dark red color, the sky is completely red, and a moon will manifest. This moon will always be red, and a wanderer will be partially blinded if they look directly at it. The most recent occurrence of this category happened on <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-10\">Level 10</a> on 12/4/22.</p><br><p>Category B blood moons are similar to Category A blood moons. They have one main difference, all wanderers killed by the flooding stay after the flood. The bodies of the wanderers have been researched, and the cause of death is drowning. Strangely, all the wanderer's blood is erased and replaced completely with the blood in the flooding.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> These bodies have allowed the M.E.G. to research this bloody liquid. It has been found to be incredibly dense, pulling anything trapped within under. This is most likely the cause of drowning. The last known occurrence of a category B blood moon was on 9/12/22. Only seven category B blood moons have ever been recorded.</p><br><p>These Blood moons are hypothetical and may not exist, but Category C blood moons erase levels. After the M.E.G's last storming of UEC's base, confidential documents containing information on an old level were completely erased by a sudden red, bloody, time-stopping flood. This flood caused all documents of its history and the existence of this level to disappear. It is unknown if this level still exists, but there is no known entrance or exit. Leading to the belief that this level has been eliminated.</p><br><p>About 30 Blood moons have ever been recorded, 23 of them being category A and 7 being category B blood moons. Over the last two years, blood moons have increased in occurrence, from happening on average every six months to 2 weeks. The reason for this is unknown.</p><br><p>Arete\u2019s eye has fallen upon our enemies, cleansing the filth and making way for perfection. Our glorious lands only grow in size thanks to Arete\u2019s bloody gratitude.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup></p><br><p>Arete\u2019s wrath will not stop until our enemies are crushed, their pathetic and misguided ideals stomped into the dirt. Two of the most detestable groups, the M.E.G. and B.N.T.G., make foolhardy attempts at stopping Arete\u2019s will. Their foolish attempts only ensure Arete\u2019s wrath will be swift and bloody.</p><br><p>Just me! <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/adikurtic\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7976254); return false;\"><img alt=\"Adikurtic\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7976254&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334080\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7976254)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/adikurtic\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7976254); return false;\">Adikurtic</a></span><br/>\nThe picture used in this article is an original picture snapped by user Mango#3152 on discord.

    "title": "Phenomenon 3 - \"Happy Dance\"",
    "description": "<p><strong>Happy Dance</strong>, also known as <strong>Exploding Wanderer Syndrome</strong>, is a terrifying new Backrooms phenomenon that proves fatal within 72 hours. It begins with the onset of an intense euphoria of mysterious origin. The victim is not psychologically elated. Their brain appears to be purposefully awash in a tsunami of natural chemicals and hormones, while their body undergoes horrific changes. Tissues in the fingers and toes, hands and feet, succumb almost immediately to aggressive gangrene and turn purplish-blue to black. In a state of perpetual bliss, the infected person taps their remaining toes and fingers while humming a happy tune, which accounts for the generic name of this malady.</p><br><p>Phenomenon 3 was officially \"discovered\" and documented by Maryann Thomas, M.D., at the <strong>Major Explorer Group Medical Clinic</strong> on <a href=\"/level-4\">Level Four</a>. Her preliminary notes follow\u2026</p><br><p>Not everyone who enters this medical clinic is injured or ill. Some are lonely, hungry, or lost. These folks know enough to feign discomfort to attempt access, usually holding their head or stomach and complaining about vague symptoms. Imagine our surprise when a dozen men danced into our facility, accompanied by M.E.G. security.</p><br><p>We were told that shortly after midnight, there was an \"event\" at the LVL-4 Sleep Center. This shelter has a thirty-bed capacity. One of the wanderers literally exploded. Ten of the men and both chaperones were contaminated by contact with biological fluids. We were also informed that nineteen other guests, probably infected, fled the scene, abandoned their belongings, and are yet to be located.</p><br><p>However impossible, given the time frame, this dozen men display advanced gangrene. Even the best talent and equipment from the <a href=\"/the-frontrooms\">Frontrooms</a> could never save these poor souls from such an aggressive strain. We can only isolate them for our protection.</p><br><p>These notes record the hours after the event and, out of force of habit, the time displayed on my mechanical wristwatch. We run our clinic on a 24-hour basis. All our medical personnel wear wind-up watches. Time observation is crucial when dispensing medications and scheduling treatments.</p><br><p><strong>7 HRS</strong> (<em>7:10 a.m.</em>): Twelve male patients arrive. They range in age from 23 to 64 years old. Despite their incurable gangrene, they all seem to be in a state of \"ecstasy\" and are constantly humming happy tunes while tapping their hands and feet.</p><br><p><strong>11 HRS</strong> (<em>11:00 a.m.</em>): An army of volunteers enabled us to transform one vacant section into a temporary quarantine site. There are now 12 beds in 4 rooms. This was part of an old office complex, and every interior door has a window. Convenient.</p><br><p><strong>14 HRS</strong> (<em>2:07 p.m.</em>): Patients no longer respond to voice or touch. Although there is always the risk of fever, I don\u2019t dare place a glass thermometer in their mouth. I am hoping that my PPE (gloves, goggles, and mask) is enough to protect me. There is no need to expose anyone else. I can handle this.</p><br><p><strong>20 HRS</strong> (<em>8:20 p.m.</em>): All patients are asleep. Heartbeat and respiratory rates are within the normal range.</p><br><p>Maryann Thomas, M.D.</p><br><p>Temporary EWS quarantine area<br/>\nM.E.G. Archives</p><br><p><strong>31 HRS</strong> (<em>7:11 a.m.</em>): Patients awake, and the song and dance continues.</p><br><p><strong>38 HRS</strong> (<em>2:00 p.m.</em>): Either all twelve males became suddenly nine months pregnant or they are experiencing acute abdominal distention.</p><br><p><strong>41 HRS</strong> (<em>5:00 p.m.</em>): I observed the patients gorging themselves on themselves. They are breaking off gangrenous tissue and eating it. Given their prognosis, I see no need to discourage this behavior, despite the ghoulish nature of the act.</p><br><p><strong>44 HRS</strong> (<em>8:00 p.m.</em>): Examining the abdomen of every patient, I was shocked to feel sensations indistinguishable from fetal kicks and movements. This is, however, the Backrooms.</p><br><p><strong>47 HRS</strong> (<em>11:00 p.m.</em>): Humming and dancing ceased. All patients are asleep. Heartbeat and respiratory rates are within the normal range.</p><br><p>Maryann Thomas, M.D.</p><br><p><strong>55 HRS</strong> (<em>7:20 a.m.</em>): Patients awake. They are quiet. This quarantine site resembles some macabre maternity ward.</p><br><p><strong>59 HRS</strong>\u00a0(<em>11:10 a.m.</em>): Patient in Room 3, Bed 3, humming loudly and thrashing about. He bursts, and the scene is worse than I imagined. I don't dare enter the room. It appears that clinical death occurs almost immediately. Biological death should follow in 4-6 minutes.</p><br><p>Knowing that something is going to occur is not the same as watching it happen. Four flexible appendages with twin rows of suckers emerge from the gaping wound in the abdomen. These arms are more brown than red and easily stretch to reach the patient's face and below his knees. The parasite possessing the arms is not visible. The arms fell limp and lifeless at (<em>11:30 a.m.</em>) and did not move again.</p><br><p><strong>61 HRS</strong> (<em>1:35 p.m.</em>): All three patients in Room 1 burst. The creatures inside all died within twenty minutes.</p><br><p><strong>66 HRS</strong> (<em>6:00 p.m.</em>): Twelve patients are dead. One of them regained awareness in those final moments. He mercifully never saw the thing that killed him. I saw it. I watched them all.</p><br><p>Doctor or not, I will never forget today.</p><br><p><strong>67 HRS</strong> (<em>7:00 p.m.</em>): Flashlight in one hand and a wooden rod in the other, I enter Room 2 and examine the closest patient. It bothers me that I do not know his name.</p><br><p>The parasite is an invertebrate with four octopus-like arms that occupies the abdominal cavity of its <a href=\"/entity-1\">human</a> host and attaches itself to several vertebrae along the lumbar spine. Nothing that we would identify as eyes or visual organs is observed. The creature has a mouth filled with teeth reminiscent of piranhas from the Frontrooms. These teeth are about a quarter-inch (4\u00a0mm) long, razor-sharp, and spaced in an interlocking pattern.</p><br><p>The abdominal cavity is clean. The organs are gone! There are no traces of intestines, liver, spleen, gallbladder, pancreas, stomach, kidneys, and bladder.</p><br><p><strong>68 HRS</strong> (<em>8:15 p.m.</em>): I scrubbed up the very best that I could and wished that I had some coffee with cream and two sugars. And a doughnut. With sprinkles.</p><br><p>I am too sad to cry. Too busy. Left instructions to continue my quarantine for another five days. If I am not infected, I will join my co-workers at the clinic.</p><br><p>If infected, I join my ancestors.</p><br><p>BURN EVERYTHING.</p><br><p>Maryann Thomas, M.D.</p><br><p>Sketch of burst EWS victim<br/>\nby Maryann Thomas, M.D.<br/>\nM.E.G. Archives</p><br><p style=\"text-align: center;\">This information is provided on a strict <strong>need-to-know</strong> basis.</p><br><p>The Major Explorer Group constantly interviews wanderers about the date they <a href=\"/phenomenon-5\">no-clipped</a> into the Backrooms. Watches and cell phones are always examined. With a stream of fresh arrivals, this data enables the M.E.G. to roughly document the passage of time in the Frontrooms.</p><br><p>Time anomalies, until now, involved the past.</p><br><p>The wanderer in bed 13 during the incident at the LVL-4 Sleep Shelter has been tentatively identified. The belongings of all guests spending nights in our shelters are kept safe in a locked area away from the sleeping quarters. These personal effects are then securely tagged with the number on the bed. A wallet found in a backpack labeled \"Bed 13\" contained both a driver's license and military identification, revealing our visitor to be 19-year-old Brian Foulkes of Cleveland, Ohio.</p><br><p>If this ID is not counterfeit, then the date of birth for Mr. Foulkes has not occurred. The credit cards in his wallet display expiration dates more than twenty years from now. Three slightly worn coins (two dimes and one quarter) display mintage marks for years that are yet to exist.</p><br><p>Brian Foulkes is, unfortunately, no longer with us to answer our questions.</p><br><p>Maryann Thomas, M.D., dedicated her existence to honoring life and saving lives. She had been the heart and soul of the <strong>Major Explorer Group Medical Clinic</strong> on Level Four since her arrival in the Backrooms. She will be missed.</p><br><p>Phenomenon 3 has been verified in areas with a larger human presence. Some researchers believe the Backrooms to be a living thing that considers people to be a disease. According to their hypothesis, Phenomenon 3 represents an antibody battling antigens. Wilder theories wonder if someone or something from the future is conducting biological warfare. They speculate, without evidence, that the influx of humans into the Backrooms is \"upsetting the balance of the multiverse.\"</p><br><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>- - - Lives hang in the balance.

    "description": "<p>No-clipping (<em>sometimes spelled noclipping</em>) is the <strong>most</strong> often experienced and <strong>least</strong> understood phenomenon in the Backrooms. So many of us have encountered it at least once.</p><br><p><strong>What is no-clipping?</strong> Successful no-clipping is suddenly traveling from one place to another, unhampered by distance or physical obstacles. All manner of living creatures and physical objects can be no-clipped. In 1990s video game culture, this reality-breaking was designated \"no-clipping.\" The term first appeared in December of 1991 with the release of <em>Commander Keen 4: Secrets of the Oracle.</em></p><br><p><strong>What does it feel like?</strong> Many wanderers describe it as falling through a thin curtain of absolute darkness. Others deny sight and sensation. Of course, as in the case of astral travel, the phenomenon experience can be radically different.</p><br><p>Like learning to open your eyes underwater, <a href=\"/annes-lament\">Amy Cochrane</a> mastered consciousness and sight during no-clipping. The world turned translucent, almost transparent, and shot by like a roller coaster, in every possible direction, while you felt that you were actually moving in slow motion. What a rush!</p><br><p><strong>How does no-clipping work?</strong> Like it or not, the answer to this question is, at present, unknowable. Theorists tackling this enigma seek the truth about no-clipping within their own dogmas. Each explanation that they give is based on their personal interpretation of the Backrooms. Perhaps the mechanism for no-clipping is a transitional amalgamation of factors and processes. Maybe everyone is correct in some way.</p><br><p>No-clipping Diagram<br/>\n(<em>activity visualized</em>)<br/>\nM.E.G. Archives</p><br><p>The original term for no-clipping is <strong>teleportation</strong>, which is defined as travel between two locations without crossing the physical space between them. American (<a href=\"/the-frontrooms\">Frontrooms</a>) author Charles Fort is credited with having coined the term in 1931. In psychical research, this paranormal transference from one place to another is called an \"apport.\" It is often documented in poltergeist activity.</p><br><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>[Due to the nature of the Backrooms, these examples are subject to change.]</strong></p><br><p>In a <strong>Stable No-clipping</strong>, performing a certain action will consistently lead the wanderer from a known and fixed Point A to Point B. Examples:</p><br><p>In the prevalent form of <strong>Unstable No-clipping</strong>, wanderers will consistently arrive at a certain level from a variety of starting points:</p><br><p>In another form of <strong>Unstable No-clipping</strong>, wanderers will start from a certain location and no-clip to a random level. Examples include:</p><br><p>With <strong>Erratic No-clipping</strong>, the wanderer wins the \"luck of the draw.\" The outcome is never clear, and the category is usually more annoying than dangerous. These occurrences are relatively uncommon:</p><br><p>We should be thankful that this category is extremely rare. The \"No!\" in <strong>No!-clipping</strong> emphasizes its tragic nature. Examples can range from:</p><br><p>Thus far, many wanderers are at the mercy of the phenomenon, which seems to be dependent on the environment. Nevertheless, there exists a faction of individuals who are able to trigger and control their no-clipping travels.</p><br><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Frontrooms Mega-clipping</strong></p><br><p style=\"text-align: center;\">Is there a size or weight limit to no-clipping?</p><br><p>Start with a large amount of steel displacing seawater. The hull of a large ship will suffice. Increase the ambient voltage with a violent thunderstorm. Now place this scenario in the Bermuda Triangle. In March of 1918, the largest ship in the United States Navy, the USS <em>Cyclops</em>, with a length of 542 feet (165 meters) and beam of 65 feet (20 meters), vanished without a trace or an SOS, with 306 people on board. More than a century later, its fate remains unknown to the Frontrooms.</p><br><p>Update: Our <a href=\"/the-m-e-g\">M.E.G.</a> Team \"<a href=\"/annes-farewell\">Epiphany</a>\" is en route to confirm rumors that the USS <em>Cyclops</em> is aground on a <a href=\"/level-246\">newly discovered level</a>. Although this will solve one of the greatest maritime mysteries ever, it is secondary to the true nature of our mission.</p><br><p style=\"text-align: center;\">* * * * *</p><br><p>In October of 1943, the USS <em><a href=\"/level-26\">Eldridge</a></em> (DE-173), with a length of 306 feet (93 meters) and beam of 37 feet (11 meters), was involved in a bizarre Navy experiment to make warships invisible to enemy radar and magnetic detonators. Special generators were designed and installed to power a new kind of harmonic force field. Switches were thrown, and the destroyer escort just vanished into thin air! It was later learned that the <em>Eldridge</em> no-clipped to Norfolk, Virginia, and then teleported back to its berth in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. According to paranormal literature and popular movies from the Frontrooms regarding this \"Philadelphia Experiment,\" many of the crew suffered horrible burns, and a few crewmen were found alive and partially embedded in the hull of the ship. Others were not so lucky.</p><br><p><a href=\"/level-365\">Anne Dunne</a><br/>\nM.E.G.

Believers in this doomsday event usually refer to this object as Nibiru or Planet X.<br/></p><br><p>~ Wikipedia</p><br><p>BLIP-00 LOG REPORT \u2014 <a href=\"/level-78\">LEVEL 78</a></p><br><p><strong>Preface:</strong> <span class=\"presumtext\">January 28, 2022 \u2014 Critical Alert Received.</span></p><br><p><strong>Note from Dr. Hawkins:</strong> <span class=\"presumtext\"><a href=\"/level-5\">Level 5</a>, <a href=\"/level-11\">Level 11</a>, and <a href=\"/level-56\">Level 56</a> might experience some anomalous occurrences within the next year, possibly due to their connection with Level 78. At best, these incidents may be minor nuisances like radio waves, but at worst, they may be full-on apocalypses. This must be urgently addressed before some cataclysm takes us by surprise.</span></p><br><p>The <strong>Nibiru Cataclysm</strong> is a hypothetical event theorized to cause tremendous fractures in spacetime should it ever occur, ripping apart the very fabric of reality. The process of the Nibiru Cataclysm generally begins with the supposed \"death\" of Blip-00, codenamed Nibiru, in Level 78. Once all of Nibiru's energy has been consumed, it will explode, similar in scale to a supernova. However, unlike typical supernovas in <a href=\"/the-frontrooms\">the Frontrooms</a> that usually happen thousands, if not millions, of light years away from Earth, Nibiru is ominously close to the destroyed remains of Level 78's space station. That gives it easy access to the levels that connect directly to Level 78, such as Level 5, Level 11, and Level 56.</p><br><p><strong>Fig. 1</strong>: The M.E.G.'s highest quality image of Blip-00. Note its uncanny resemblance to an eye.</p><br><p>While the concept of level traversing has not been fully understood, it is widely believed that two levels with a common entrance or exit will generally be right next to each other on the fabric of spacetime. For example, this means that Level 11\u2019s environment is \"physically\" next to Level 78's environment. For the most part, this distinction has no relevance to the average wanderer. However, to the blips of Level 78, this makes all the difference\u2014it is precisely what allows the destructive <a href=\"/entity-52\">Null-06</a> to continue its vindictive streak. By entering the blips, which double as \"portals\" to different realms (other levels of the Backrooms), Null-06 can effectively consume entire areas in a fraction of a second.</p><br><p>This information forms the basis of the theory describing the Nibiru Cataclysm. When a blip dies, its respective \"portal\" destabilizes, resulting in two separate realms conjoining. However, since a single blip can act as a portal to <em>multiple</em> levels, this is not simply a matter of two levels combining\u2014it is a matter of several hundred levels combining all at once. According to Level 78 researcher Dr. Mateen, this event would be akin to \"imagin[ing] Level 11's tallest skyscraper puncturing through the heart of <a href=\"/level-906\">the Cygnus Archive</a>, with imperfect geometric shapes from <a href=\"/level-404\">Level 404</a> terrorizing the bookshelves.\"</p><br><p>The apotheosis of this phenomenon exists as <a href=\"/level-38\">Level 38</a>, which was discovered shortly after the formation of the blips (and was likely born from the aforementioned event). Level 38's complete proliferation of disorder makes it nearly impossible to discern which parts are unique aspects of the level and which aspects came from other levels. Marked by sheer instability and confusing geometry, this amalgamation of approximately 40 different levels proves to be a nightmare for the brain to comprehend. Wanderers in levels affected by the Nibiru Cataclysm tend to experience debilitating migraines caused by overworking the brain while trying to comprehend the landscape. In rare cases, this can result in fatalities\u2014approximately 20 lives have been lost to brain shutdowns<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup>.</p><br><p>And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence<br/>\nSave breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.</p><br><p>Blips, formally believed to simply be anomalies in spacetime created by Null-06, were discovered to have sentience after the sounds created by Ad Astra's microwaves were deciphered as Morse code. These waves appear to be a form of communication between blips, though they are also coincidentally understandable by humans. When Nibiru started sending waves in early 2022, researchers decoded its message roughly as \"Now, I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.\" This uttered phrase from the Bhagavad-Gita serves a double meaning in the context of Blip-00, researchers believe. A leading theory is that Nibiru is foreshadowing its destructive potential after the quick evisceration of Level 78's space station by its sibling blip. However, more apocalyptic prophets have predicted that Nibiru is close to death, which would release all of its energy simultaneously in a single blast. Pointing to recent observations of Nibiru fluctuating in brightness, proponents of this theory believe that it is rapidly depleting more energy than it can consume. With nearly half the level already annihilated by Ad Astra, Nibiru now relies on destroying remaining small stars to quell its ever-growing hunger<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup>.</p><br><p>Should Nibiru die, the first event that will happen is gravitational collapse\u2014all of the matter surrounding Nibiru will be rapidly pulled into the center, nicknamed \"The Eye.\" From there, an expansion outward will commence at speeds rivaling that of light, sending the contents of Nibiru flying through space and the \"barriers\" that separate levels from each other. In the aftermath, nothing but a ring of dust and a glowing orb is to remain of Nibiru.</p><br><p><strong>Fig. 2</strong>: A rough model of the events that will transpire when Nibiru dies.</p><br><p>However, the effects of Nibiru's death will not simply be isolated to Level 78, as once thought. By destroying the \"barriers\" between levels, the Nibiru Cataclysm opens up prime opportunities for spontaneous no-clipping incidents, stranger architectural conglomerations, and even unnatural entity hybrids. These three key aspects are already heavily present in the highly unsafe Level 38, and the death of Nibiru will only expand the number of levels that succumb to Level 38's \"fold point\" physics.</p><br><p><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">As of now, based on current observations of Nibiru, there is no perceived threat to levels that are connected to Level 78. The possibility of Nibiru dying this early when no other blip shows any signs of impending death is estimated to be around 10%. This information, however, is subject to change.</span></p><br><p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Possibility raised to 70%<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')\">3</a></sup>.

This will likely accelerate its decline in the near future, but for now, this should not be of any concern. The increased consumption of energy is quite miniscule. At most, this will reduce its lifespan by approximately 200 years, which is completely trivial when compared to Nibiru's projected lifespan of 9,375,000,000 years. Our species will be dead by then. There's nothing to worry about.</p><br><p><strong>Preface:</strong> These were sent over a 5-month period from 02/01/2022 to 07/01/2022.</p><br><p><strong><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">-. . ...- . .-. -- --- .-. . .-.-.-</span></strong><br/>\nTranslation: \"Nevermore.\"</p><br><p><strong><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">-- .- .-.. .. -.-. .. --- ..- ... / . -.-- .</span></strong><br/>\nTranslation: \"Malicious Eye\"</p><br><p><strong><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">- .... . -. / ... .--. .- -.-. . / -... . --. .- -. / - --- / - --- .-.. .-..</span></strong><br/>\nTranslation: \"Then space began to toll\"</p><br><p><strong><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">.-- . / .- .-. . / .-- .- - -.-. .... .. -. --. .-.-.-</span></strong><br/>\nTranslation: \"We are watching.\"</p><br><p><strong><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">.- .--. --- -.-. .- .-.. -.-- .--. ... .</span></strong><br/>\nTranslation: \"Apocalypse\"</p><br><p><strong><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">-.-. .- - .- -.-. .-.. -.-- ... --</span></strong><br/>\nTranslation: \"Cataclysm\"</p><br><p><strong>Date of Report:</strong> 08/03/2022.<br/>\n<strong>Subject:</strong> Blip-00.</p><br><p><strong>Status:</strong> Highly Unstable<br/>\n<strong>Change in Mass since Last Report:</strong> +3.0 x 10<sup>31</sup> km.<br/>\n<strong>Change in Radius since Last Report:</strong> -1,200,000\u00a0km.<br/>\n<strong>Current Mass:</strong> 9.7 x 10<sup>31</sup> km.<br/>\n<strong>Current Radius:</strong> 87,000\u00a0km.</p><br><p><strong>Other notes:</strong> Nibiru's gravitational pull is skyrocketing\u2014unfortunate stars coming even within several million kilometers of Nibiru will get engulfed in the blink of an eye.

The mechanisms by which these noises occur are similar to that of the blips in Level 78. Though a link is suspected, it cannot be confirmed as of yet.</p><br><p>These noises strike usually when a wanderer\u2019s senses are relaxed\u2014that is, when a wanderer is in a state of peace and quiet. Whether the sounds only occur in areas of silence or if they are simply more perceivable in silence is unknown at this time. The latter is more widely believed due to the odd tendency of the sound to increase in volume the longer a wanderer\u2019s senses remain unstimulated.</p><br><p>The source of the noise cannot be definitively identified\u2014it seems to propagate in all directions, being everywhere all at once. It is not any quieter indoors than it is outdoors. It is a constant auditory assault from which there is no escape. It has transcended its original label of \"minor inconvenience\" and has been grouped with enervating tinnitus.</p><br><p>The M.E.G. has conducted several interviews with some victims of this occurrence. For the sake of brevity, the full transcripts will not be posted here\u2014however, some notable quotes will be provided below for reference:</p><br><p>\"You ever heard of Keyboard ASMR? It's basically that, except instead of soothing you, it makes you want to rip your ears off.\"</p><br><p>\"Imagine listening to tap dancing 24/7. Try living your whole life like that.\"</p><br><p>\"It feels like there's an analog clock stuck in my brain, ticking down to who knows what. Gosh, if only I could get rid of it.\"</p><br><p>As of now, residing in Level 11 is not recommended. Temporary camps have been established in <a href=\"/level-1\">Level 1</a> to help displaced wanderers.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p><br><p>Level 56's novel \"singularity\" room has started to engage in uncharacteristic behavior, with its vacuum chamber now having a suction force. Ice is being sucked into the hole without any indication of where it might land\u2014with all this matter being consumed, the level might soon be destroyed. According to witnesses, this caused a violent shaking in the level rivaling that of even the strongest earthquakes. As a result, the M.E.G. has immediately evacuated all their research bases in the level due to the cave's instability. Though falling stalactites have injured many M.E.G. operatives (with the most severe injuries requiring the amputation of several limbs), there were no reported fatalities.</p><br><p>Evacuees reported a consistent clicking noise, similar to those in Level 11. The circumstances of this noise remain almost entirely the same as the noises in Level 11, but there is an added effect of an echo due to the level's massive cave structure. However, this time, the M.E.G. has a general idea of where the sound could be coming from\u2014it seems to originate from the singularity itself.</p><br><p>Look, I know it sounds unorthodox and everything. Just trust me on this. I think we can all agree that areas close to the singularity have a climate comparable to that of outer space\u2014there's been a lot of research done on this, so I won't delve into the details. So, my theory is this: what if the climate is like outer space because the core of the level itself is a gateway to outer space? We've already established the existence of an entry to Level 78 through Level 56, and that singularity does have some characteristics of the vacuum of space. Katie, what was our last reading of the core's temperature?</p><br><p>Approximately 2.3 Kelvin.</p><br><p>The core's pressure?</p><br><p>Off the top of my head, I'd say about 80 nanopascals.</p><br><p>Does this not sound like outer space to you? Our measurements are consistent with this theory. I think this level is connected to Level 78 in more ways than just an entrance\u2014if anything odd is going on Level 78, I think we'll be able to formulate some more explanations as to why all these occurrences are going on here.</p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p><br><p>Time does go on.<br/>\nI tell it gay to those who suffer now.<br/>\nThey shall survive.<br/>\nThere is a sun.<br/>\nThey don\u2019t believe it now.</p><br><p>Though it has been largely hypothesized that <a href=\"/object-95\">Object 95</a>'s doomsday prophecy pertains to the <strong>Nibiru Cataclysm</strong>, there has been little evidence to support any explicit connections besides the shared threat of an impending apocalyptic scenario. However, the simultaneous occurrence of these two incidents cannot be solely attributed to coincidence. Specific events speculated to take place during the rapture include, but are not limited to:</p><br><p>The third point holds a solid amount of significance to conspiracy theorists, primarily because Null-06 is not only known to be capable of destroying levels\u2014it is known to have already destroyed several levels. However, researchers have never been able to identify which levels have been destroyed, serving as evidence that when Null-06 destroys a level, every wanderer's memory of it subsequently disappears.</p><br><p>What would happen in any given level upon Nibiru's death is a complete mystery. Some levels will be impervious to the effects, but most will experience at least one side effect. The worst case scenario is the creation of a \"rip\" in spacetime, generally seen as a small, two-dimensional tear that leads into nothingness or a completely different area. If enough spacetime rips are created, a fold point situation not dissimilar to Level 38 is very likely to occur, with several foreign level environments entering the home level at once.</p><br><p>The main property of \"fold points\" is the inability for the brain to identify any singular object in them. Everything seems familiar enough to possibly exist in our current reality, but there's always something off about its patterns that our brains are unable to recognize. The <strong>Nibiru Cataclysm</strong>, therefore, will plunge us into realms beyond our understanding by transforming once-habitable areas into unidentifiable frontiers.</p><br><p>With it comes that ubiquitous feeling of being watched. Nibiru's influence strikes when wanderers is relaxed and not paying attention. This has been observed with the clicking noises, and researchers believe that Nibiru's all-seeing \u201cEye\u201d also watches those who do not watch it. This is a near-universal sign that the level one currently resides in will be consumed, as it is a sign that a rip in spacetime has occurred.

    "description": "<p>Dr. John Rhinehart, PhD, of the M.E.G. Team \"<a href=\"/annes-farewell\">Epiphany</a>,\" said it best:</p><br><p>This place is no random accident. The Backrooms is the most purposeful truth I can imagine. It is as if dozens of demigods are constantly painting an ever-evolving montage of bizarre existence dedicated to taunting the <a href=\"/entity-1\">humans</a> trapped here. This hydra of creativity, this Liminal Echo, grows day by day, watered by our tears and fertilized by our fears.</p><br><p>Our scientific consultant is not the only wanderer to wonder why the negativity here exceeds all laws of chance and probability. Levels and entities keep popping into existence, one after another. Are these things being discovered <strong>or created</strong>?</p><br><p>Phenomenon 7 was probably first encountered when the original wanderer bounced off a smelly, wet carpet to the madness of \"mono-yellow\" and noise of \"hum-buzz.\" It was officially discovered and named only recently, in a thesis submitted to the <a href=\"/the-m-e-g\">Major Explorer Group</a> by Doctor Rhinehart.</p><br><p>The discovery began with research into the echoes of liminality pervading most levels. What was immediately noticed was that the liminal spaces in the Backrooms were artificial and grossly exaggerated. Someone or something was weaponizing liminality and waging a psychological war on wanderers. More facts fell into place, and the M.E.G. realized that almost everything about the Backrooms was geared to be detrimental to humans.\u00a0</p><br><p>If we are not welcome here, why does something keep trapping us in this impossible space? <strong>Are we somehow feeding this unreality?</strong></p><br><p>Unless we believe that these levels and entities are happy little accidents, we must consider the distinct possibility that most were intentionally formed with a purpose. They are being created by an intelligence familiar with the Frontrooms, and then twisted into liminal caricatures of our reality. There are, however, so many facets to these creations that it is difficult to accept that they could ever originate from a single source.</p><br><p>As of this writing, there are roughly 400 levels of varying danger and strangeness. Most of these places are incomprehensible to us, while several levels are recognizable translations of Frontrooms locations, such as:</p><br><p><strong>Due to the nature of the Backrooms, these examples are subject to change.</strong></p><br><p>We also share the Backrooms with about 200 entities displaying a wide range of temperament and intelligence.</p><br><p>Dreams are the original liminal space. Every one of us has our own unique liminal dream zone. Is it mere coincidence that some levels and entities have dreamlike or nightmarish qualities? We ask again, <strong>\"Are we input?\"</strong></p><br><p><em>Please note that this document is a concise overview of the phenomenon composed for rank and file M.E.G. personnel and wanderers. The samples below represent four of the examples that have been investigated in the process of compiling this report. Total discourse on this phenomenon will require encyclopedic information. Research is ongoing.</em></p><br><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/level-283\">Level 283</a> - <strong>\"PlayLand\"</strong></p><br><p>Level 283 Ball Pit<br/>\nM.E.G. Archives</p><br><p>When it comes to levels, what you see is almost never what you get.</p><br><p>Still, your childhood beckons. This place is an infinite playground with perpetual recess. Impossibly, if that word can ever apply here, the entire level is indoors. There are tunnels, tubes, and slides. Your heart aches at the sight of your favorite, a ball pit! Does it really go on forever? There are teeter-totters, monkey bars, merry-go-rounds, and swing sets. Everything is innocent.</p><br><p>Despite the intrinsic nostalgia, this playground comes with playmates. <a href=\"/entity-8\">Hounds</a>, <a href=\"/entity-15\">Wretches</a>, <a href=\"/entity-10\">Skin-Stealers</a>, <a href=\"/entity-3\">Smilers</a>, <a href=\"/entity-5\">Clumps</a>, and <a href=\"/entity-9\">Facelings</a> play here. <a href=\"/entity-183\">Carnies</a>, a Level 283 exclusive entity, may prove friendly or not.</p><br><p>If you are lucky, you will exercise maturity and live another day.</p><br><p>If you are not so lucky, you will answer the call of the ball pit and dive in with glee. Innocence will end as you sink helplessly beneath the waves of brightly colored liminality. There is no escape once you go under.</p><br><p>Liminal Echo springs the perfect little trap.</p><br><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/level-148\">Level 148</a> - <strong>\"The Living Level\"</strong></p><br><p>Level 148<br/>\nCreative illustration<br/>\nM.E.G. Archives</p><br><p>Hostile entities can cause pain and death. Some environments are toxic to wanderers; they harm without intent. Only in the Backrooms do we find a murderous habitat with consciousness.</p><br><p>There are three things to know about Level 148:</p><br><p>The first fact is that the level is truly alive and sleeps, hunts, eats, and, most importantly, can communicate.</p><br><p>Secondly, the level cooperates with a massive population of entities. These seem to be far more aggressive and intelligent, and include: Hounds, Stranglers, Clumps, <a href=\"/entity-25\">Plague Goblins</a>, Smilers, Child Facelings, <a href=\"/entity-130\">Growlers</a>, <a href=\"/entity-400\">Mimics</a>, and <a href=\"/entity-134\">Phobic Centipedes</a>. There are no reports of this level harming any entity.</p><br><p>Never forget that Level 148 kills human trespassers. Communications between this level and wanderers has led to the conclusion that \"the level is actively intelligent, manipulative, and acts with malicious intent\" toward human beings. The entity can communicate by either inscribing its messages on the walls or speaking to the wanderer.</p><br><p>Phenomenon 7 makes being human a crime worthy of the death penalty.</p><br><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/level-444\">Level 444</a> - <strong>\"The Level Without Form\"</strong></p><br><p>Level 444<br/>\nM.E.G. Archives</p><br><p>Level 444 is an unstable level that regenerates itself about once every hour. The lights go out for 10\u201315 seconds, and everything changes, with the new interior apparently assembled at random. Flashlights do not work during this brief interlude. Some walls can appear to have no collision, and furniture and objects can get stuck inside. After these hourly revisions, objects and structures from different levels or pertaining to entities that appear only in certain levels can be found. These include:</p><br><p>Entities encountered here can include: <a href=\"/entity-4\">Deathmoths</a>, Hounds, Skin-Stealers, Smilers, <a href=\"/entity-17\">Crawlers</a>, and <a href=\"/entity-24\">Death Rats</a>.</p><br><p>Until now, the Backrooms offered fragments of familiarity based on scenes and objects from the Frontrooms. Level 444 offers familiarity with entities, objects, and places in the Backrooms. Is this an evolutionary development? Is this because people born in the Backrooms have no emotional connection to the Frontrooms? Did Liminal Echo create this level to have an unsettling impact on individuals native to the Backrooms?</p><br><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/entity-123\">Entity 123</a> - <strong>\"Your Name Here\"</strong></p><br><p>Nametag<br/>\nCreative illustration<br/>\nM.E.G. Archives</p><br><p>Entity 123, \"Your Name Here,\" is a spectral nightmare that targets wanderers based on their surname. It often takes the form of an evil doppelganger, or supernatural double, of the quarry. It can also manifest as a horrifying event or circumstances beyond the victim's control, with every encounter revolving around the name of its prey. Credible sources have traced this murderous trail across both the Frontrooms and Backrooms.</p><br><p>The entity has a terrifying purpose, and it's personal. People enjoy hearing and seeing their name. Liminal Echo turns this affinity into a reason to die.</p><br><p><strong>Areas with the highest human concentration have the lowest concentration of Phenomenon 7.</strong></p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/phenomenon-6\">Phenomenon 6</a> | Phenomenon 7 | <a href=\"/phenomenon-8\">Phenomenon 8</a> \u00bb</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/phenomenon-7\">Phenomenon 7</a>\" by Robert Goerman, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

Exiting is simple, if you are not alone. Your out-of-paper partner must draw a door on the paper, exiting through the door will take you to the closest door to the paper.

Do you need any sustenance or sleep? Does your body get physically exhausted?<br/>\nL: That seems like more than the first, but whatever. I do require things like food, but not as much as people do. I do get exhausted after a while, but can \u201crecharge,\u201d so to speak, quickly.<br/>\nO: Okay, next question. What was your \u201ccreation\u201d like?<br/>\nL: Can you elaborate?<br/>\nO: What were your first moments like? After you got drawn?<br/>\nL: Ah. Well, it was strange. When I was first created, I had no memories, no experience, but I knew how to walk, talk, and navigate. It was like my mind already knew what to do.<br/>\nO: Hm, good to know. Next question. What was it like before your creation?<br/>\nL: Well, it\u2019s hard to put. It\u2019s like bits of your mind caught in a tornado. They come and go with rapid succession, none of it makes sense. Until, it all started condensing. Before I knew it, I was standing in front of my own creator.<br/>\nO: Okay, this will be your final question. What is your experience with incident 18579-B?<br/>\nL: *deep sigh* It was tragic. Seeing your own kind and the one who brought them to life all perish\u2026 I feel like leaving the team that day is justified. It still haunts me now, but I am trying to move on.<br/>\nO: Y-yeah.

Anyway, we sent a team to influence the creation of the level. Nothing huge of course, after all it was our first attempt. Just setting up a small convenience store to make the area useful. We had fifteen employees noclip with reality Refreshers and prototypes to manipulate the environment.</p><br><p><strong>Notes:</strong> Well\u2026 it <em>may</em> be true that we lost the entire team in an <em>unfortunate</em> incident, but if you look at the bright side you always learn better from your mistakes.

Of course, with the information obtained with the first attempt, our team knew how to improve and use the equipment well in order to carry out our task with structural Smoke.

They are avatars \u2014 many of which walk amongst you without betraying their true nature or even their existence. Here, I intend to shed light on these mysterious beings, and demystify them.</em></tt></span></p><br><p><span class=\"Special\"><tt><em>Avatars are incredibly powerful and influential beings, so godlike in stature that many were in fact once worshipped as a <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-pantheon/offset/1\">pantheon</a> of gods by <a href=\"/the-lost\">ancient humans</a>. The source of this power/influence are the <a href=\"/the-pillar-scripture\">Pillars</a>, which serve as Oversouls for their respective avatars. Each avatar holds command and mastery over a particular concept, that being the one embodied by their respective Pillar. Individual avatars have the capability to alter and impact an aspect of The Backrooms itself, within their respective conceptual sphere.</em></tt></span></p><br><p><span class=\"Special\"><tt><em>Avatars exist to spread the influence of their respective concept in the mundane reality. An avatar may naturally manifest from or be directly created by a Pillar, or result from a being embodying a specific concept so strongly that they forge a connection with the Pillar of that concept. I have come to learn that I am an example of the latter, as the result of my\u2026blessings from <a href=\"/th\">The Terminus</a>. The nature of an avatar\u2019s relationship to their Pillar can vary widely. Sometimes, they may be considered separate, with the Pillar indirectly guiding the avatar or having no involvement. Other times, the Pillar and avatar may be one and the same in consciousness, with the avatar being a direct incarnation/manifestation of the Pillar. In the latter case, every action performed by the avatar is of their oversoul's intentional will.</em></tt></span></p><br><p><span class=\"Special\"><tt><em>Yet for all their power, avatars are not entirely invincible. A part of their nature is dependent on their relationship with mortals, and with the Backrooms itself. As such, there are several means by which one may render an avatar vulnerable to mortal death \u2014 some swift and merciful, others slow and agonizing. The first weakness is for the link between an avatar and Pillar to be weakened or completely severed, for avatars lose all their power and immortality without it. The second weakness is death at the hands of another avatar, for they are of equivalent power. And the final weakness is being forgotten, for avatars only remain in power as long as they are known of and recognized. They may only truly die along with the last to remember their name.</em></tt></span></p><br><p><tt><em>If avatars may be considered gods, then their champions may be considered akin to demigods or the heroes of myth.</em></tt></p><br><p><tt><em>Just as avatars bridge the gap between Pillars and mortals, champions bridge the gap between mortals and avatars. They are similar in nature to avatars, though with several distinguishing features which make them less powerful or influential than the latter. Unlike avatars, champions do not share a direct connection with a concept, but rather the avatar they are linked to; although a Pillar may still indirectly influence and affect a champion through that connection. Just as an avatar draws their power from a concept, a champion draws their power from an avatar. Champions come to be when an avatar creates life in their image, or a mortal is imbued with a portion of an avatar\u2019s essence or power. Depending on the circumstances of their creation, a champion's degree of power relative to the avatar \u2014 and even other champions of the same avatar \u2014 can vary, though it is never greater than the avatar's. Furthermore, avatars are not always aware of the existence of their champions. When an avatar</em> is <em>indeed aware, they may revoke the power granted to their champions on a whim as seen fit \u2014 particularly if the champion is deemed unworthy through their actions.</em></tt></p><br><p><tt><em>There is much debate over whether becoming a champion/avatar makes one greater or lesser than human, but I am afraid such philosophical discussions are beyond the scope of this writing. Perhaps in the future, I may dedicate a volume entirely to that subject.</em></tt></p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/phenomenon-9\">Phenomenon 9</a> | Phenomenon 10 | <a href=\"/phenomenon-11\">Phenomenon 11</a> \u00bb</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/phenomenon-10\">Phenomenon 10</a>\" by (user deleted), from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

    "title": "Phenomenon 12 - \"Botanicancer\"",
    "description": "<p><strong>Phenomenon 12</strong>, commonly known as Botanicancer, happens in areas where man-made construction takes up more space than original buildings and local flora, which is the main reason why there is hardly any large base or settlement in nonarchitectural levels.</p><br><p>Botanicancer can affect both inner structures and outer walls of construction, wildly growing a variety of plants at an alarming rate, which will quickly cover every inch of the affected building and eventually replace every concrete or brick with roots and vines. During the early stage of Botanicancer, hundreds of green shoots crawl out of the wall like hungry worms. Then in a few minutes, leaves and buds sprout, and flowers bloom immediately after they appear. The overwhelming growth of plants continuing, leaves grow much wider and blossoms expand longer than regular plants. It all happens within less than an hour.</p><br><p>When the aggressive flora reach a certain scale, its growth slows down, leaving the building fully covered by toxic leaves and blossoms. If the people are not evacuated in time, they will be trapped by these plants. In the next few days, their destruction continue until the whole structure is completely ruined.</p><br><p><strong>Phenomenon 12</strong> happening a few minutes ago, shot by the owner of the house.</p><br><p>\"Diseased\" road. The plants have been removed.</p><br><p>The \"diseased\" construction usually collapses in a few days, leaving contagious plants spreading throughout the neighborhood. The only way to prevent their spread is to burn the remains as soon as possible. Once the vines reach another building, the same disaster happens all over again, and there is no way to stop botanicancer in the middle of its attack. However, since most of the plants have lost their energy then, it is less dangerous to take care of them.</p><br><p>It is unadvisable to approach those cancerous plants during the attack, not to mention to exterminate them. In fact, those plants always try to grasp any object they can reach to expand their territory as much as possible. If caught, vines will wind around wanderers' bodies and drag them into the twirling plant complex.</p><br><p><strong>Phenomenon 12</strong> happens with various kinds of plants growing, most of which resemble but differ from those in <a href=\"/the-frontrooms\">the Frontrooms</a>. They are harmful in many ways.</p><br><p>Beasten Ivy is the most common cancerous plant making up the body of the botanicancer flora. Like Boston Ivy, it is a woody vine with huge leaves, attaching itself to things like walls. But differently and more violently, it is natuarlly drawn to any object that can be wound up by it. Its unbelievable strength and growing speed make it almost impossible to escape once caught by it. Those who are not careful will be made a part of the flora in a nonhuman way.</p><br><p><strong>Siris</strong>, initially named Silencing Iris, is a kind of flower commonly seen during a botanicancer attack. It is believed to be capable of blocking certain types of information.</p><br><p>The most obvious situation it leads to is that wanderers fail to hear sound in the surroundings. When near a siris, it absorbs many kinds of waves in the air, excluding most of the electromagnetic waves like visible light. These sirises can somehow affect brain waves, making wanderers nearby stop thinking from time to time. With one's mind blank, it is much harder to escape from the disaster.</p><br><p>As its name suggests, mourning glory mourns for the wanderers' death, or to be more accurate, feeds on their death. They immediately appear after someone is dragged into the complex of plants and then quickly decompose their bodies to imbibe nutrients from them.</p><br><p>Great Buster refers to the entirety of roots inside walls of an infected construction. Contrary to common senses, these roots are not parts of a plant that convey water and nutrients, but an individual plant that grows as fast as Beasten Ivy does, squeezing and busting structures from inside.</p><br><p>Some of those exposed to botanicancer flora and lucky enough to escape from it have come down with a strange disease, which is likely to be an infection from buildings to humans. To make a distinction, this disease is named Human Botanical Cancer, often abbreviated HBC.</p><br><p>The pathogenesis, the way HBC develops, is related to the extremely resilient seeds of botanicancer flora. It seems that those seeds can normally grow inside human bodies, slowly and painfully tearing apart one's organs and tissues.</p><br><p><em>Notes taken by Dr. Elliot K. Miller, M.D. from <a href=\"/the-m-e-g\">the M.E.G.</a>, on symptoms of a HBC patient he treated.</em></p><br><p><strong>Less than an hour after being infected</strong></p><br><p>The patient claims to suffer from headache, stomachache and bellyache. According to his description, he constantly feels his limbs and chest swelling from inside, and something squeezing their veins and organs. It cause slight but long-lasting pain.</p><br><p><strong>After 4~7 hours</strong></p><br><p>He starts to have trouble breathing, talking and swallowing. A few stems and leaves stretch out from his mouth, anus, ears, nose and even eyeholes. Some shoots sprout in the pores of the skin.</p><br><p>I've never seen any symptom like this before. It's mind-blowing and horrible to look at. I have to find out what it is.</p><br><p><strong>After 7~10 hours</strong></p><br><p>Leaves have covered his whole body. I heard a continual weak noise\u2026\u2026 The poor guy's screaming out of pain but could barely utter a sound. It's getting worse, and I couldn't find a cure for this.</p><br><p><strong>After 10~15 hours</strong></p><br><p>It's both a miracle and a disaster that he's still alive. I could hardly tell he's an actual humam being. Roots tightly gripping the ground, he's now complete lost the ability to move. A tree\u2026\u2026 That's what he became.</p><br><p><strong>After 15~19 hours</strong></p><br><p>I thought he had become a tree but it's just not that simple. He's still breathing. I can see it. The heartbeat\u2026\u2026 He literally got every space in his poor body stuffed with plants. My goodness, what horrible pain! I have to do something right now.</p><br><p><strong>After 19~22 hours</strong></p><br><p>Simply cutting off the stems and leaves did not help. They grow so fast that it's impossible to conduct any operation. His breath was weakening. The last time I checked on him, his body is already cold and dead. I'm more than sorry\u2026\u2026</p><br><p>Unfortunately, <strong>Phenomenon 12</strong> is rather unpredictable, unstoppable and irreversible. The cause of this phenomenon remains debatable, with the most accepted statement being \"the defence of the Backrooms\".</p><br><p>Oddly enough, Botanicancer only infects construction built by wanderers while what consists the backrooms long before human beings set foot here is free of its threat, which many people believe is the way backrooms itself expel those who do not belong, which is <em>us</em>.</p><br><p><em>A speech delivered at M.E.G. base alpha, by Dr. Elliot K. Miller, after his 2-year long battle with Botanicancer.</em></p><br><p><a href=\"/entity-1\">The humans</a>, the plague of backrooms, are cursed with <a href=\"/phenomenon-3\">deadly euphoria</a>, spied on by <a href=\"/entity-3\">avatars of darkness</a>, trapped in hells where homesickness can never be cured. Now that our hard-won sanctuary is once again shown on mercy to, we give in to backrooms' absolute might, which we wouldn't even dare to fight against.</p><br><p>We crawl back to that <a href=\"/level-11\">endless city</a>, a \"home\" backrooms arranged for us, sharing a place with creatures we fear, living under thumbs of a selfish god. It is a perfect clone of Frontrooms but nothing like home.</p><br><p>Our existence is detested. Our search for home is unpromising. Our shelters are torn apart. Our lives are at the risk of being taken away by unexpected attacks of literally any-goddamn-thing.</p><br><p>Despite our misery, the backrooms itself stays perfectly unchanged. The marching vines and roots, their cure yet our disease, forthwith wreck what's enthetic to them. On days like this, when we fail to find our way out of hell over and over, the birds are still singing and flowers keep blooming, silently killing hopes of humanity.</p><br><p>We come here with plagues. They treat us with cancer.</p><br><p>Fair enough, fair enough.</p><br><p><strong>Author:</strong> <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/eltrac\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(8286092); return false;\"><img alt=\"Eltrac\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=8286092&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334073\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=8286092)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/eltrac\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(8286092); return false;\">Eltrac</a></span></p><br><p><strong>Image Source:</strong></p><br><p><strong>Image Source:</strong></p><br>",

    "title": "Phenomenon 13 - \"A Way Out\"",
    "description": "<p>So Close\u2026</p><br><p><strong>Phenomenon 13</strong>, otherwise known as <span style=\"color: red\"><tt>\"A Way Out\"</tt></span>, is an advanced form of meditation that has been refined and perfected by a radicalized religious cult known as \"The Egress Brotherhood\". It has been shared and taught to those whom The Brotherhood has deemed \u201cworthy\u201d to initiate into its ranks. The Egress Brotherhood has claimed that over the past 3 years, they have been able to successfully re-enter <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-frontrooms\">The Frontrooms</a> via this technique. According to multiple sources within The Brotherhood, they have developed <span style=\"color: red\"><tt>\"A Way Out\"</tt></span> for nearly 3 decades and have only recently been able to develop a 7-step plan that, according to them, is guaranteed to grant anyone who completes the process the ability to no-clip back into The Frontrooms. Investigations overseen by high-ranking <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-m-e-g\">M.E.G.</a> officials has been able to confirm the veracity of these rumors. <span style=\"color: red\"><tt>\"A Way Out\"</tt></span> is currently being tested in a highly controlled setting to verify the legitimacy of the methods involved.</p><br><p>Informants within The Brotherhood have confirmed that the organization was a highly religious cult that developed over the centuries as part of one of <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-lost\">The Lost</a> societies, and broke off following multiple foundational altercations. Records of The Lost archives have provided very little documentation and evidence about the history of The Brotherhood, which indicates a disgraceful and hostile breakup. Following the break-off, The Brotherhood expanded its membership and has developed a strong foothold within several different levels \u2014 the most notable of which is <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-63\">Level 63</a>.</p><br><p>On June 15th, 2017, following multiple reports of a religious cult cordoning off sections of meditation points in Level 63, M.E.G. Team \"Volunteer Squad\" entered the level and was able to subdue nine members of the cult, while the rest fled from the scene. In an apparent vow of silence, 7 of the detained cult members refused to say anything in the subsequent interrogation. Of the remaining 2, 1 merely uttered the words:</p><br><p>\"You fools don't realize salvation is right in our hands.\"</p><br><p>They did not speak again following this statement. The last remaining cult member (assumed to be the most recently indoctrinated) was the only one willing to cooperate, agreeing to divulge what he knew in an interview. The interview has been transcribed below.</p><br><p><span style=\"color: white\"><tt><strong>Interviewer:</strong></tt></span> Field researcher \u201cLeaf\u201d.<br/>\n<span style=\"color: white\"><tt><strong>Interviewee:</strong></tt></span> Brice Bentley, Member of The Egress Brotherhood.</p><br><p>&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;<br/>\n<span style=\"color:white\"><tt><strong>Leaf:</strong></tt></span> Please state your name for the interview.</p><br><p><span style=\"color:white\"><tt><strong>Bentley:</strong></tt></span> Brice Bentley.</p><br><p><span style=\"color:white\"><tt><strong>Leaf:</strong></tt></span> Okay, good. So let's just jump straight in. Tell me why you are here and your affiliation with The Egress Brotherhood.</p><br><p><span style=\"color: white\"><tt><strong>Bentley:</strong></tt></span> I was a deeply religious man back in The Frontrooms. The moment I entered this endless purgatory, my mind nearly broke, and my faith wavered. After many months, I was introduced to The Brotherhood. Something inside me turned on the moment I found out about them. As if God himself had arranged for it to happen, I immediately reached out to them and was graciously accepted into their ranks.</p><br><p><span style=\"color: white\"><tt><strong>Leaf:</strong></tt></span> Hmm\u2026 that's all well and good, but I was hoping you would tell us more about what The Brotherhood was planning on doing in Level 63. Preventing access to meditation points at that level is a very serious transgression in the eyes of many wanderers, including The M.E.G.</p><br><p><span style=\"color: white\"><tt><strong>Bentley:</strong></tt></span> Look, I will be the first to say it. As much as I am devoted to The Brotherhood, I have not been given the most up-to-date information, probably because I am only a recently converted member.</p><br><p><span style=\"color:white\"><tt><strong>Leaf:</strong></tt></span> Surely, you must have heard something from someone. What information can you give us, then?</p><br><p><span style=\"color: white\"><tt><strong>Bentley:</strong></tt></span> I've heard a lot of things, some true and some not, but I can't get into the exact details, however, I do know this for certain. They've found it.</p><br><p><span style=\"color:white\"><tt><strong>Leaf:</strong></tt></span> Found what?</p><br><p><span style=\"color:white\"><tt><strong>Bentley:</strong></tt></span> A Way Out.</p><br><p><span style=\"color:white\"><tt><strong>Leaf:</strong></tt></span> A way out\u2026?</p><br><p><span style=\"color:white\"><tt><strong>Bentley:</strong></tt></span> Yes! Can you believe it? We can finally leave this wretched place. I almost couldn't believe them when they first told me, but I was convinced after seeing the results myself.</p><br><p><span style=\"color: white\"><tt><strong>Leaf:</strong></tt></span> Are you saying The Brotherhood has found a way to escape The Backrooms and enter back into The Frontrooms?</p><br><p><span style=\"color:white\"><tt><strong>Bentley:</strong></tt></span> That is exactly what I am saying!</p><br><p><em>At this point, Researcher Leaf is left in mild annoyance.</em></p><br><p><span style=\"color:white\"><tt><strong>Leaf:</strong></tt></span> Oh\u2026 you're one of <em>those</em> cults.</p><br><p><span style=\"color:white\"><tt><strong>Bentley:</strong></tt></span> I can tell you don't believe me.</p><br><p><span style=\"color:white\"><tt><strong>Leaf:</strong></tt></span> I'm sorry, it's just\u2026 we've spent our lives here trying to escape, and it just so happens that this random brotherhood no one's ever heard of has found it. We've dealt with organizations like yours before. Outlandish claims are a dime a dozen here, but this may take the cake.</p><br><p><span style=\"color:white\"><tt><strong>Bentley:</strong></tt></span> Sometimes you just need a little faith.</p><br><p><span style=\"color:white\"><tt><strong>Leaf:</strong></tt></span> I'm all ears, then. How on earth did you find a way out?</p><br><p><span style=\"color: white\"><tt><strong>Bentley:</strong></tt></span> As I said, I'm very low on the hierarchy, but I do know this. There's some kind of written plan. I've never seen it myself, but what I've been told is that it has 7 steps. If you can complete the 7 steps, you can leave The Backrooms.</p><br><p><span style=\"color:white\"><tt><strong>Leaf:</strong></tt></span> Where is this\u2026 <em>plan?</em></p><br><p><span style=\"color:white\"><tt><strong>Bentley:</strong></tt></span> That's where your luck ends, my friend. Only the eldest and most loyal members of The Brotherhood have access to the plan.</p><br><p><span style=\"color:white\"><tt><strong>Leaf:</strong></tt></span> Hmm\u2026 I see. Well, we have all the time and resources in the world to find it.<br/>\n&lt;END LOG&gt;</p><br><p><span style=\"color: white\"><tt><strong>Follow Up:</strong></tt></span> Owing to Brice Bentley's claims, obtaining either a portion or the entirety of the Brotherhood's 7-Step Plan is now a high-level priority.</p><br><p>Following the interview, a concerted effort was made to track down and obtain any items or objects related to The Brotherhood or information relating to the 7-Step Plan. Initial attempts were frustrated by members of The Brotherhood, who used <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/objects\">undocumented objects</a> to evade capture on the verge of apprehension. After a nearly two-year-long investigation involving raids and interrogations, the following document was finally pieced together. It is believed to be the official 7-Step Plan.</p><br><p><span style=\"color:red\"><tt>A Way Out</tt></span></p><br><p>Upon the completion of the 7 trials, you will be cleansed of all the sins you have accumulated in your life. Trek to <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-63\">Tranquility</a> and continue your final journey. Immediately after discovering a meditation point, isolate yourself and begin <span style=\"color: red\"><tt>\"A Way Out\"</tt></span>.

Visualize every aspect of this moment as hard as you can. Continue this process until you think you have achieved \u201cThe True State\u201d and open your eyes.

Below is a log of the tests that took place over 15 months.</p><br><p>After 4 successful tests in a row, M.E.G. researchers announced at a monthly summit that they had found <span style=\"color: red\"><tt>A Way Out</tt></span> of The Backrooms. In order to prevent the chaos and disorganization of a mass exodus, the Overseers initially planned to gradually release information about the 7-Step Plan to multiple waves of wanderers over a set period of time. In the 10 months following, estimates have put the number of wanderers to have escaped The Backrooms to be 7,<br/>\n<span style=\"color:black\"><tt>[FILE AUTOMATICALLY LOCKED DUE TO POTENTIALLY FRAUDULENT SECURITY AUTHORIZATION. PLEASE INPUT CREDENTIALS BELOW TO CONTINUE.]</tt></span></p><br><p><iframe allowtransparency=\"true\" class=\"html-block-iframe\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"/phenomenon-13/html/a739fea75d141d2726fa1dda23bdb7676786f96c-1276008653638877622\"></iframe></p><br><p>To those of you who have access to read this far into this file, I think you know why this has been kept so secret for so long from so many people. However, I know one day, someone, somewhere, somehow would get access to this file without the appropriate clearance, and if you are reading this memo, then you are the one. I believe you are owed an apology and an explanation for what is happening.</p><br><p>Your mind is probably filled with hundreds of questions, but one remains front and center. \u201cThere is a way home, and <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-m-e-g\">M.E.G.</a> is hiding it from us?\u201d The entire goal of The M.E.G. is to find a way home, and preventing anyone from knowing how to go back home is the antithesis of our very foundation. So why did I lock this file so that no regular wanderer could see it? This file doesn\u2019t tell the whole story. Sure, the Egress Brotherhood and their 7-Step \"<em>Plan</em>\" exist, but their beliefs were\u2026 <span style=\"color:#8b0000\">mistaken.</span></p><br><p>When I saw the first 3 tests on the cultists who seemingly disappeared back into The Frontrooms following the completion of the 7-Step Plan, I could not begin to put into words what I was thinking at that moment. We would no longer have to suffer in this \u201cendless purgatory\u201d. We could start our lives over again, go back home, leaving the past behind us, but it is never that easy here, <em>is it?</em></p><br><p>If only.</p><br><p>We know <span style=\"color:#8b0000\">the real truth</span> now.</p><br><p>The 7-Step Plan doesn't send you back home. It just sends you deeper into the prison we are trying to escape. The list of all those we sent to their deaths stretches on and on, each more gruesome than the last:</p><br><p>We found every single body. Every last one. Not <em>one</em> of them got out. This is just one small portion of the list, and trust me when I say that each corpse was more horrifying than the last. Whatever this is, it's certainly not even close to a way home.</p><br><p>We were already about to release this file on the Database when the first bodies started to turn up. Even then, in our hubris, in our desperation\u2026 we <em>kept going</em>. By the time we figured out what we'd done, and locked out this file from the public permanently, the body count was in the hundreds. At this point, you might be asking yourself, \u201cIf this phenomenon is so dangerous, why not just delete it entirely?\" The answer is simple. This document was never meant for you. It is meant for the rest of <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-m-e-g\">us</a>.</p><br><p>I lie awake at night thinking about what we did. Sending wave after wave after wave of innocent folks to their demise. Not knowing what we were really doing is our greatest failure \u2014 and my greatest burden. Their blood is on our hands, and we cannot atone.</p><br><p>That is what has led us here. This very file\u2026 an undying memory of what we have done. What we have caused. Giving away this dangerous information without knowing the whole truth has doomed so many. We cannot forget what happened here, and we cannot forgive ourselves. Too many people have been lost for us to just wipe it off the record books and pretend it never happened. I have failed in my job as an Overseer. I'm guilt-ridden over all those we sent down this path.</p><br><p>Yet, I keep this entire file up as a constant reminder to those that need it most: Never give up. No matter how much suffering this dreaded place causes, <strong>Do. Not. Lose. Hope.</strong> We will find <em>a way out</em> of here. <strong>I swear on it.</strong></p><br><p>\u2014 <tt><strong>Overseer C</strong>, Andrew</tt></p><br><p><a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/nq4tcJz77r0\">People Walking Between Tall Buildings</a> By Shawnanggg, sourced via Unsplash under <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en\">CC By-SA 3.0 License</a><br/>\n<a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:%D0%9D%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%89%D1%96_%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%96_%D0%B6%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%82%D1%8F.jpg\">Rhododendron flowers in the Carpathian Mountains</a> Sourced Via Wikimedia Commons under <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en\">CC By-SA 3.0 License</a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/theme:meg-edgy\">Theme</a> created by <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/kai4c\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7335456); return false;\"><img alt=\"Kai4C\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7335456&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730704518\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7335456)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/kai4c\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7335456); return false;\">Kai4C</a></span><br/>\n<a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/joke-very-important-level-document\">Authorization Terminal Code</a> written by <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/frrixy\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7849082); return false;\"><img alt=\"Frrixy\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7849082&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730704518\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7849082)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/frrixy\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7849082); return false;\">Frrixy</a></span><br/>\nCritiques/Major help from: <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/kai4c\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7335456); return false;\"><img alt=\"Kai4C\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7335456&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730704518\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7335456)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/kai4c\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7335456); return false;\">Kai4C</a></span> &amp; <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/praetor3005\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(8321734); return false;\"><img alt=\"Praetor3005\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=8321734&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730704518\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=8321734)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/praetor3005\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(8321734); return false;\">Praetor3005</a></span></p><br><p>The Man Behind the <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">Slaughter</span> Article:<span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/iqloose\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(8535742); return false;\"><img alt=\"Iqloose\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=8535742&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730704518\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=8535742)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/iqloose\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(8535742); return false;\">Iqloose</a></span></p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/phenomenon-12\">Phenomenon 12</a> | Phenomenon 13 | <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/phenomenon-14\">Phenomenon 14</a> \u00bb</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/phenomenon-13\">Phenomenon 13</a>\" by Iqloose, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

It happened naturally, almost within a blink of an eye. Then, an unbearable noise came in, and I instantly knew something bad was right around the corner.</span></p><br><p><span style=\"color: #969696\">\u2015</span></p><br><p><span style=\"color: #ff9192\">[Theresia]</span><span style=\"color: #ffffff\">: \u2026I was in my office with some of my companions, \u2015you know, inside one of the buildings of Level 11, nearly at the highest floor. I\u2019m sure my eyes weren\u2019t deceiving me since everyone seemed to be as puzzled as I was.</span></p><br><p><span style=\"color: #ffffb5\">[Interviewer]</span><span style=\"color: #ffffff\">: \u2015Their colour, what did they look like?</span></p><br><p><span style=\"color: #ff9192\">[Theresia]</span><span style=\"color: #ffffff\">: \u2026Their colour was the same as it always was. They seemed like clear anomalies in that environment, as if they shouldn't have really been there\u2026 Then, some small stuff began falling upwards. \u2015I really should have grasped the meaning of that signal, but it all just happened so fast\u2026</span></p><br><p><span style=\"color: #ffffb5\">[Interviewer]</span><span style=\"color: #ffffff\">: Could you tell me what kind of 'small stuff' you are talking about? \u2015Currently, what comes to my mind are things like pencils, bottle caps, or maybe even paperclips.</span></p><br><p><span style=\"color: #ff9192\">[Theresia]</span><span style=\"color: #ffffff\">: \u2015Yeah, no. Not at all, not even close. It's much more insignificant stuff, to the point where it almost feels like it's deliberately made like that so that one doesn't notice. Minuscule stuff like pebbles, stones, dust\u2026 \u2015That kind of\u2026 thing.</span></p><br><p><span style=\"color: #ffffb5\">[Interviewer]</span><span style=\"color: #ffffff\">: I see\u2026</span></p><br><p><span style=\"color: #ff9192\">[Theresia]</span><span style=\"color: #ffffff\">: And after that\u2015.

Everyone began panicking and shouting as if their very lives were on the line; of course they did, it was horrifying\u2026 Who could've prepared us for this? It's so unfair\u2026</span></p><br><p><span style=\"color: #969696\">\u2015</span></p><br><p><span style=\"color: #ffffb5\">[Interviewer]</span><span style=\"color: #ffffff\">: (\u2026)</span></p><br><p><span style=\"color: #ff9192\">[Theresia]</span><span style=\"color: #ffffff\">: I could've sworn some shouts had been way louder than the others, especially coming from outside\u2026 That's why, no matter what, I never gained the courage to look out the window. \u2015So there I was, crying my eyes out in the midst of that nightmare, curled up against the shattering concrete of the ceiling, patiently awaiting for that mysterious force to go away at last.</span></p><br><p><span style=\"color: #969696\">\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</span></p><br><p><span style=\"color: #ff9192\">[Theresia]</span><span style=\"color: #ffffff\">: \u2026Of course, though, I learnt about all that happened outside soon after from other colleagues. That day, I got it clearer than I ever have. Even if we think we can gather in groups and settle in what we would consider \"safe\" places, it's all but mere self-deception. \u2015In the end, we all are and will always be at the mercy of\u2026 this hell of a place.

You sense a certain familiarity but you don't see where it originates from.</p><br><p><strong>#Phenomenon</strong> <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki-cn.wikidot.com/component:plas\">17</a></p><br><p><strong>Class</strong> 2</p><br><p><strong>Category:</strong> Manifestation</p><br><p><strong>Distribution:</strong> Broad</p><br><p><strong>Modality:</strong> N/A</p><br><p>You begin to feel nervous. This place is safe \u2014 no disgusting Dogs or those dead-walking but fucking clever Partygoers.</p><br><p>But you just want to find a way out.</p><br><p>You try to remember how you first entered this zone. You were escaping from a certain monster-like entity you had never seen in your life down here. That was close.</p><br><p>You saw a door. A door very similar to\u2026 to something you remember. Yes. You just have to find that door.</p><br><p>Phenomenon 17 is the designation given to the recurring resemblance between certain areas of the Backrooms and the Frontrooms, and additionally, several analyses and hypotheses centred around this particular phenomenon. To be specific, Phenomenon 17 refers to but is not limited to the following incidents or peculiarities:</p><br><p>Where is that door?</p><br><p>You swear you saw that like ten minutes ago. A mere door can't move. It must be somewhere. Search carefully, you say to yourself.</p><br><p>In vain.</p><br><p>Yeah well this is not the Frontrooms where everything is so easily organised\u2026 Did you just say the Frontrooms?</p><br><p>Now you see where that familiarity comes from.</p><br><p>Some analyses and hypotheses have suggested that Phenomenon 17 is evidence of a connection between the Backrooms and the Frontrooms, or that the Backrooms is a distorted or alternate version of the Frontrooms. Others have suggested that the resemblance is simply a result of the human brain's tendency to impose patterns and meaning onto random stimuli, or that it is a deliberate design choice by whoever or whatever created the Backrooms. Despite various speculations and theories, the true nature of Phenomenon 17 remains unclear, and the possibility of a deeper connection between the Backrooms and the Frontrooms continues to intrigue and elude wanderers and researchers alike.</p><br><p>Some wanderers claim to have experienced Phenomenon 17 firsthand, reporting instances of familiar sights, sounds, and sensations while in the Backrooms. These experiences can range from brief flashes of recognition to extended periods of intense nostalgia, and are often accompanied by a sense of unease or disorientation. While these reports are largely anecdotal and difficult to verify, they add to the mystery and intrigue surrounding Phenomenon 17.</p><br><p>The door. It's from that bedroom you lived in at like four years old. That was a painful experience. It was dark, wet and very, very unpleasant, especially with your parents continually fighting and cursing with every word you just didn't know the meaning back then.</p><br><p>And this place you're in. You remember it as well.</p><br><p>If you find yourself in an area of the Backrooms that resembles a location in the Frontrooms, it can be disorienting and unsettling. Try to focus on the differences between the two places, such as the lighting, sounds, and textures. This can help ground you in the reality of the Backrooms and prevent you from becoming lost in the illusion of familiarity.</p><br><p>That playground from your kindergarten. The kindergarten where the teacher beat you up everytime you wished to go to the bathroom while everyone else was taking the noon nap \u2014 why blame you? You were only four you couldn't control. That total bitch \u2014 you learnt this slur from your father. This was the playground where you went and cried silently after school, and then the teacher would show up and scold you out of the campus.</p><br><p>How does the Backrooms know this. You've hidden these traumata so well.</p><br><p>These are the reasons why you don't seek love; why you never meant to be a teacher; why you have to sleep with a nighttime lamp on; why you clean your house so often people think you have mysophobia.</p><br><p>How should the Backrooms know this. This can't be.</p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p><br><p><tt>Remember, coping with Phenomenon 17 can be challenging, but it is possible. By staying focused, vigilant, and connected to others, you can navigate the Backrooms and may finally find your way back to the Frontrooms.</tt></p><br><p><tt>Any familarity you see \u2014 it's not real. Find the difference. Don't get overwhelmed.</tt></p><br><p><tt>The M.E.G. is with you.</tt></p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p><br><p>Get the fuck out of my memories this instant.</p><br><p>Get out.</p><br><p>Get out.</p><br><p>Get out.</p><br><p>Get out.</p><br><p>Get out.</p><br><p>Get out.</p><br><p>Get out.</p><br><p>Get out.</p><br><p>Get out.</p><br><p>Get out.</p><br><p>Get out.</p><br><p>Get out.</p><br><p>Get out.</p><br><p>Get out.</p><br><p>Get out.</p><br><p>Get out.</p><br><p>Get out.</p><br><p>Get out.</p><br><p>Get out.</p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/phenomenon-16\">Phenomenon 16</a> | Phenomenon 17 | <a href=\"/phenomenon-18\">Phenomenon 18</a> \u00bb</p><br><p>My appreciation goes to the following people who read (and gave advice on) this article:<br/>\n<span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/princebun\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7989330);

The name itself was decided by the <span style=\"color: #947ab4\"><strong>Infinite Wanderer</strong></span> and it is a name all who yield to <strong>Phenomenon 18</strong> self-identify with. There is only one <span style=\"color: #947ab4\"><strong>Infinite Wanderer</strong></span> at a time, and all who hold the title are aware of their succession in a lineage.</p><br><p>A destination seems distant, more abstract as the travels wear on. The self-declared title of \u201c<span style=\"color: #947ab4\"><strong>Infinite Wanderer</strong></span>\u201d would suggest an infinite journey, after all. Yet, this does not bring despair to the one who walks the constant journey. There is a peace that is unique to the <span style=\"color: #947ab4\"><strong>Infinite Wanderer</strong></span>, a contentedness that only they hold dear.</p><br><p>Death often occurs sooner than expected for individuals on this infinite journey. However, this is not blood on the hands of <strong>Phenomenon 18</strong> but rather a natural consequence of following the direction of the body onto dangerous levels, often underprepared. Still, the topic of the death that each iteration will see often comes up when in discussion with the <span style=\"color: #947ab4\"><strong>Infinite Wanderer</strong></span>, lined by the curiosity of why. \u201cWhy traverse a path so long when you won\u2019t be alive to see the reward?\u201d \u201cWhat point do you see in such a pointless journey that others cannot?\u201d But the <span style=\"color: #947ab4\"><strong>Infinite Wanderer</strong></span> finds little occupation in this topic, stating \u201cto be part of the story is more important than to be the conclusion\u201d.</p><br><p>There exists simultaneously the personal memories of the individual, such as friends and interests, and the memories of the <span style=\"color: #947ab4\"><strong>Infinite Wanderer</strong></span>, that being the steps taken on their path. The memories of the individual are lost with the death of each successor, but the memories of the <span style=\"color: #947ab4\"><strong>Infinite Wanderer</strong></span> remain unwithered for eternity. They report never having walked the same trail twice, acutely aware of the steps they\u2019ve previously taken, even on infinite levels. This does not rule out revisits to levels and sublevels on the <span style=\"color: #947ab4\"><strong>Infinite Wanderer</strong></span>\u2019s path, however, and multiple iterations have been known to spend their time solely on one level.</p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p><br><p>Becoming the <span style=\"color: #947ab4\"><strong>Infinite Wanderer</strong></span> does not grant one eternal life or impenetrable skin. As previously mentioned, each iteration of the <span style=\"color: #947ab4\"><strong>Infinite Wanderer</strong></span> will eventually die. Upon the death of a predecessor, a new individual will be overcome by <strong>Phenomenon 18</strong>. The intake of the new knowledge that comes with this is instantaneous, the path ahead now obvious. <strong>Phenomenon 18</strong>\u2019s transition from one individual to another is fast, increased by proximity to the predecessor.</p><br><p>Although proximity was initially believed to be the determining factor, this has many times since been disproven. The only location-based influence in the choosing of the next <span style=\"color: #947ab4\"><strong>Infinite Wanderer</strong></span> is that the individual is in a place the <span style=\"color: #947ab4\"><strong>Infinite Wanderer</strong></span> has not walked before. Ultimately, anyone within these specifications has the possibility of falling next in line.</p><br><p>There are no characteristics that occur significantly enough to conclude a selective nature to <strong>Phenomenon 18</strong>. There are, however, characteristics that the individual welcomes or sees an expansion of upon gaining their new title. The <span style=\"color: #947ab4\"><strong>Infinite Wanderer</strong></span> is never without a careful and well-prepared attitude, as best as one can be in such a place. They know an unnatural yet peaceful joy that stays loyal until death and an odd trust in the leadership of their body over their own. That is not to say that the individuals who become the <span style=\"color: #947ab4\"><strong>Infinite Wanderer</strong></span> are independent of their unique personalities and quirks. They never wholly discard who they once were in light of who they become. Instead, they exist as an amalgamation of themselves and the <span style=\"color: #947ab4\"><strong>Infinite Wanderer</strong></span>.</p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p><br><p>Interviews with the <span style=\"color: #947ab4\"><strong>Infinite Wanderer</strong></span> are rare, so they must be conducted thoroughly. Below are some quotes of particular interest along with the original names of the speakers and the level they were interviewed on.</p><br><p><span style=\"color: #b6a2ce\">\u201cIt\u2019s easy to overthink what\u2019s so hard to understand. This is no pilgrimage, no entity, no bout of impulsivity. I am the <strong>Infinite Wanderer</strong> and I am also me. My name is Alexander and my name is the <strong>Infinite Wanderer</strong>. This does not distress me. I am part of the journey and that will forever be true. I am content, and I am grateful to be me.<br/>\nI should say that I have been here before. On this level, I mean. Not as Alexander, however. Truthfully, I cannot recall the name of the one who walked that path. It\u2019s been a while, afterall, yet I still remember the steps I took well.\u201d</span></p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>-<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><em>Alexander Norwell on <a href=\"/level-853\">Level 853</a>, 23 December, 1974</em></p><br><p><span style=\"color: #b6a2ce\">\"So\u2026 imagine you\u2019re walking and everything around you is dark. But you, you\u2019re light. Not just a light but THE light. And, even though right now you can\u2019t see super far ahead, when you get there, you will light the way. That\u2019s how it feels to be a part of this journey. There is no path without me, and that\u2019s part of what makes it special. And I think that makes me special too.\"</span></p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>-<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><em>Ashley Hernandez on <a href=\"/level-162\">Level 162</a>, 13 November, 1998</em></p><br><p><span style=\"color: #b6a2ce\">\u201cI really don\u2019t mind at all.

Even on the levels where it\u2019s really scary, like I was on <a href=\"/level-789\">Level 789</a> before this. Even there, I was still happy.<br/>\nOh, the memories. At first, they were\u2026 I don\u2019t want to say painful but a lot to process at the same time. Overwhelming. I had to stand there and be like \u2018Woah, this is something\u2019. The <strong>Infinite Wanderer</strong> memories are different to the Raven memories. They\u2019re always there, always. It\u2019s not like remembering things either. I\u2019m just aware of things. Also, they aren\u2019t in my head- or my mind, I mean. They\u2019re outside my body and all around me.<br/>\nStill overwhelming? Nope.

We spent so long looking to give it back that <strong>Phenomenon 18</strong> came to us instead. Fate works in strange ways, my friend, you should know that well. I\u2019m joking by the way. Don\u2019t put this in an actual research report. Look, I\u2019m not gonna give some cult-like speech on why you should stick around \u2018til I die. You\u2019ve got a lot more work to do now anyway.<br/>\nI wish I could explain this better for research and all that, give you something big to go back with. Reality is that I have nothing you haven\u2019t heard before. On a personal level, please know that I am okay. I\u2019m happy, I swear. And seriously, don\u2019t stay with me. You\u2019ve got more in store for you than following a guy to his death.

    "description": "<p>Radio Waves of the Past, or RWP for short, summarizes the phenomena of which several backroom devices pick up on old waves (radio waves being the most common, thus the name) and then broadcast speeches, messages, etc., that seem altered. They all convey similar intentions/themes about disruption in the Backrooms. Anyone can be affected by this phenomena, so it is important to identify when and if this occuring, and to be carful to follow the do's and don't 's.</p><br><p>The messages have been happening more frequently. So far, there is no way to prevent them from being recieved.</p><br><p>There have also been a few unverified reports of messages through emails and other forms of communications. Here is a file containing all of them so far:</p><br><p>Title: Strange Emails<br/>\nFrom: Starrise2<br/>\nTo: Staff<br/>\nI would like to inform the staff of a certain incident with other users. I have lately been recieving emails from different accounts with similiar names, such as \"Unknown\", \"Unidentified\", and \"error\", etc. They all have been sending messages about war, threats to society, etc. I know that I reported to you about the first one, who was named \"Thing\", and you dealt with them, upon which they deleted their account. I have my settings set to where only people who are fellow site members can contact me. But I would imagine you would be more effective in your filtering them. Isn't it obvious someone is sockpuppeting and harassing me with their accounts? You shouldn't let them join when you know they are the same person causing a problem. Please do something about it.</p><br><p>Re: Strange Emails<br/>\nFrom: Maxwood<br/>\nTo: Starrise2<br/>\nHi, I am the head of disciplinary for our organization. We recently recieved your report about the accounts who seemed to be sockpuppets of a previous user you said was harrassing you that we banned. Unfortunately, we have found no records of such users in the database, and therefore no one to punish. We can't figure out how you can be recieving messages from members who are not on-site if you are have your settings set the way you say you have them. Perhaps double-check it to make sure?</p><br><p>Re: Strange Emails<br/>\nFrom: Starrise2<br/>\nTo: Maxwood<br/>\nYep, my settings are exactly the way I said they were.</p><br><p>Re: Strange Emails<br/>\nFrom: Maxwood<br/>\nTo: Starrise2<br/>\nOkay. Well, there isn't much we can do. Send me screenshots of these Emails. I do know a certain someone who has been investigating a phenomenon that has recently come up. It does sound similiar to what you are experiencing. I'll forward them to him, and see if he can figure it out. If you recieve any other messages, notify me.</p><br><p>Re: Strange Emails<br/>\nFrom: Starrise2<br/>\nTo: Maxwood<br/>\nI will try and ignore them, and send them to you when I recieve them. I would say thank you\u2026but\u2026</p><br><p>Re: Strange Emails<br/>\nFrom: Maxwood<br/>\nTo: Starrise2<br/>\nI undestand. I apologize that we can't do more.</p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:110%;\"><span style=\"color: #f5f5f5\"><strong>CurtainCalls</strong></span></span> <span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><span style=\"font-size:95%;\"><span style=\"color: #6e727a\">Yesterday at 21:19</span></span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #cacbcd\">I need to talk to you.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:110%;\"><span style=\"color: #f5f5f5\"><strong>MightyXXX</strong></span></span> <span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><span style=\"font-size:95%;\"><span style=\"color: #6e727a\">Yesterday at 21:20</span></span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #cacbcd\">That's what I'm here for.

Why weren't these messages heard in the Backrooms during the years they were made? I believe many questions like this one can be answered, once we have more information. These old speeches being broadcasted could also point to Backrooms being on a different\u2026time than the frontrooms. We could have been transported from 2016 and ended up in 1942 in the Backrooms. There recently was the discovery of a wanderer who died from <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/phenomenon-3\">Phenomena 3</a> whose identification said his birthdate was one year in the future. We don't, as far as I know, have an actual timeline of every year in the Backrooms, and we have no way of finding out what is happening in the frontrooms at this very moment. We don't even know when in the frontrooms is occurring right now. Therefore, it is possible some entity or person from the future might be messing with old radio waves and rebroadcasting them. There is unfortunately no way to prove this theory.</p><br><p>As you mentioned, this is mostly a theory. It can't really be proved. If you can't prove it, don't include it. You need evidence, or at least an explanation. Explain how it is possible for these radio waves to still be around.</p><br><p>Radios have two separate parts: The transmitter, and the receiver. The transmitter takes some sort of message (it could be the sound of someone's voice, pictures for a TV set, data for a radio modem, or whatever), encodes it onto a sine wave, and transmits it with radio waves. The receiver receives the radio waves and decodes the message from the sine wave it receives. Both the transmitter and receiver use antennas to radiate and capture the radio signal. In our case, we know what the receiver is. The radios, computers, etc. that are broadcasting these speeches. If we wanted to, we could figure out the original transmitter, but not the current one. It could be possible that someone is taking the original speech and editing it, but it is as equally possible that the receivers are picking up old radio waves, or something else entirely. I suggest we keep a close watch on these messages. If we allow ourselves to get too used to something, we'll only get surprised and in a state of vulnerability when it comes back to bite us. It is entirely possible this is more than just a strange happening in the Backrooms.</p><br><p>Overall, the voices themselves on the radio pose no threat. They appear to just be alterations of old broadcasts. The context of the speeches themselves may have been altered due to the amount of time or distance they took to be picked up by a receiver. The only way they can hurt you is if you allow yourself to get scared and confused by them.<br/>\nFurthermore, after months with no sign of possible war, it has been concluded that the Backrooms is under no threat of invasion. The only concern the people living in the Backrooms should be worried about is the <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">rapid</span> slight increase in entity numbers. Don't pay any attention to any messages you may receive via radio, computer, or other electronic means, even if the messenger seems to be sending a warning, threat, plan, or declaration of war.

Not only have these nighttime events recurred for months, many have reported experiencing the same dreams as others. If you suspect that you are being affected by this anomaly, please seek assistance and do not sleep alone as it may lead to extended rest.</em><br/></p><br><p><br/>\nIt was like a dream<br/>\n<br/>\nFleeting, ephemeral<br/>\n<br/>\nSuch is the nature of my memories, tinted like smoked glass<br/>\n<br/>\nI can see fragments of it in my mind<br/>\n<br/>\nA spattering of images drifting through the synapses of my brain<br/>\n<br/>\nIncomplete moments that piece together to form a broken puzzle<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could call it a level<br/>\n<br/>\nI can't even tell you if it exists<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was inside and outside at the same time. A dark, unforgiving forest and infinite winding halls made of red wood, faded and rough like the exterior of an old barn. The tunnels match the ebb and flow of the hills and the natural shape of the forest, two conflicting concepts that are unyieldingly separate but are truly one. I can't see the floor, perhaps there isn't one. My footsteps echo silence down the halls into infinity. I've dreamt of this place several times, always picking up where I left off. I make ample progress; it's much easier to explore when you don't need to eat or drink. I finally come to an elevator, a silvery machine ready to whisk me away. The moment I enter it I look around, it is made of glass. I see a universe of clouds, their fluffy cumulus drifting lazily into infinity with the midday sunlight dancing off of them. The doors close and I am floating in this new world beyond the stratosphere.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery time the elevator would move, I would awaken<br/>\n<br/>\nContinue with my day like nothing had happened<br/>\n<br/>\nUnable to recapture my slumber<br/>\n<br/>\nI finally find rest again, returning to my elevator. It moves with nary a sound and with incredible smoothness as it glides upwards. As it travels, the blue of the sky fades and melts into buttery twilight, the oranges and pinks of the setting sun scattering across the voluminous surfaces of the clouds. The elevator finally came to a rest, the doors slide open ever so gently. I step out into a new world, a carnival swathed in autumn and an effervescent sunset. I wander through it, the fallen leaves in their orange and brown swirling around me as a gentle breeze runs through the carnival like a secret river. It brings with it the warmth of summer and the chill of winter, a place truly in between. The red and white striped tents are empty, husks sitting as vacant silhouettes against the decaying sunlight. The rides, teacups and rollercoasters, are dead and gone, inoperable remains without a proper burial. I lament their loss, the joy they will no longer be able to bring. I wander on until I reach the edge of the world, the elevator once again waiting for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe shades of night descend upon the elevator<br/>\n<br/>\nI once again awaken within my slumber to this mysterious world<br/>\n<br/>\nIts gossamer strands tethered by this strange machine of glass<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce the moonlight fully shines across the clouds, the doors open once more. I am again thrust into a wondrous world. It is the dead of night, the stars twinkling their charming lights at me, the crescent moon beaming with pride across the dirt path on which I stand. The air is humid and warm. I see a woman there, I see her face, but it changes like the surface of water. Each time I blink, her face is different, a million different people in her eyes. She holds my hand, and I feel her warmth and kindness as she pulls me down the path. Fireflies pierce the shadows as they lazily float around us. We marvel at their beauty. She brings me to a lake, her hand letting go of mine as she steps into the placid mirror. I see the stars reflecting onto the surface as I plunge in after her, though there is no water. I enter it like one would walk through a threshold, stepping as gravity accommodated our adventure. I gaze back at the reflection that was once me and continue on in the world inside the lake. She takes my hand once again, guiding me back to my bastion of tempered glass.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am awake, yearning to return to sleep<br/>\n<br/>\nCraving the dreamscapes painted by my subconscious<br/>\n<br/>\nAlas, I must live<br/>\n<br/>\nSlogging through the haunting corridors of an abandoned universe<br/>\n<br/>\nMy eyelids shutter.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel a poignant stab in my heart. Perhaps it is instinct, but I know my time here is coming to an end. The sunrise blossoms in the distance, coloring the clouds with liquid butter. The elevator reaches its destination, and the doors open. I am in a great and sparkling sea. The morning lights playfully tease the roiling surface of the ocean, and dolphins breach the surface with merriment and mirth as they corkscrew through the air. I see an island in the distance, a sandy atoll with a single palm tree stoically enduring the winds. As I walk across the water, curious fish of all shapes and sizes follow my footsteps with vapid interest. Large, blue waves rumble along in front of me, and I laugh. I sprint up the side of one and roll down another. I giggle; they're just like hills. I finally make it to the beach, removing my shoes as I walk around my tiny islet tucked away in the great sea. I can feel the sand beneath my feet, each warm grain shifting from my weight, wedging between my toes. The ocean is calm as I look down and see a single seashell sitting alone, nestling cozily into the sand. I gently remove it from its earthen grave, brushing stray particles from its smooth surface as I inspect it. The shell is white, with thick ridges running its length. Soft, dirty pink trims the edges of the ridges while the inside contains a pearlescent shine. I put the shell into my pocket and begin to walk to the center of the atoll.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see my reflection, but it's not me. With each ripple, the image changes. Different people, some young, some old. Mostly me. Sometimes not. Life, like the tides, changes quickly, and so do I. I smile as this small oasis is the end of my journey. The water vanishes and I am on the clouds I had long admired in my dreams. The sun has fully risen, and I walk across their bouncy surfaces into the horizon.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter that, the dreams finally stopped.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy reveries had become mundane, and my sleep more irregular. I wanted to go back, but I didn't know how. Was it even real?<br/>\n<br/>\nSeveral days had passed, and I had been folding my clothes. I felt an odd lump in the pants pocket of a pair of jeans, so I reached in and pulled the object out.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a small, white seashell.<br/></p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/phenomenon-20\">Phenomenon 20</a>\" by DivineAtlas, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

    "description": "<p>The corpses are affected by Phenomenon 21 regardless of the circumstance of their passing. While those who have died in the presence of none have always been found in their altered form, those who have died while in the presence of other individuals appear to be affected once they are out of the vision of every involved individuals.</p><br><p>The alterations are similar to the process of embalming which is common on Planet Earth, but has fallen out of practice in the Backrooms due to a lack of qualified personnel, the often chaotic circumstances of fatalities, and a shift in the cultural practices of the population of the Backrooms. The bodies appear to have been washed, groomed, and fitted with formal clothing. Their eyes are shut, and their lips produce a slightly smiling expression, the result of a small operation using sutures within the mouths of the dead. The corpses appear to not be subject to rigor mortis, as their muscles are relaxed. It is not known who or what is behind Phenomenon 21.</p><br><p>A sense of peace fills those who witness the bodies. The Phenomenon has been described as an opportunity to allow those who have lost their loved ones during tragic events to grieve.</p><br><p>Since the apparition of Phenomenon 21, access to <a href=\"/the-grave\">The Grave through astral projection</a> has been found to be impossible. The implications are not fully understood, although they may signify that Phenomenon 21 also alters the afterlife in the Backrooms.</p><br><p>\u2026 This place never fails to surprise me.<br/>\n<br/></p><br><p><tt>For once, it is a good surprise.</tt></p><br><p><tt>For the living too, don't you think?</tt></p><br><p><tt>Yet, not one soul escapes it, all must play a part in it.</tt></p><br><p><tt>All that was known was The Grave. A grim perspective, but at least we had <em>an idea</em> of where we would go.</tt></p><br><p><tt>\u2026 You're a curious mind, are you not?</tt></p><br><p><tt>I can sense that your mind wanders, you are one that hates doubt.</tt></p><br><p>Strange fellow, capable of reading minds. Their hazel eyes looked directly into mine, and an odd feeling crept in. It was not dread nor fear, but an understanding of the surreal nature of this exchange, an understanding that they who stood in front of me were no human.</p><br><p>They knew that I knew.</p><br><p><tt>A bright mind, I see.</tt></p><br><p><tt>It already has been.</tt></p><br><p><tt>The body in front of us\u2026 It's you.</tt></p><br><p><tt>Tell me, do you remember what you look like?</tt></p><br><p>Well yes, I\u2026 I\u2026. Uh-</p><br><p>No further words came out. Confusion flooded my soul, something broke in me. Memories were distant and blurry.</p><br><p><tt>Your mind died long before your heart did.</tt></p><br><p><tt>Long gone, I fear.</tt></p><br><p><tt>Taken care of by wanderers. They all played along your disease, letting you \"organize\" things. You were the eldest of the base.</tt></p><br><p><tt>Time will tell. You died recently. A matter of a few hours.</tt></p><br><p><tt>No, I am not torturing you and yes, it is real. Come, we will discuss.</tt></p><br><p>My surroundings were swallowed by a vast emptiness, only to be replaced by something else.</p><br><p>The stairs led to an attic.</p><br><p>A place I was most familiar with.</p><br><p>Home.</p><br><p>I saw an opened door showing the stairs leading to the attic, but I felt a pressing urge to revisit the house. Everything stood in place, like how it was the day I no-clipped. When I entered the kitchen, I saw the half-finished cup of coffee, the bag of bread I left open, and the newspaper of that day, dated on the 7th of April 1983. That day I had to leave early for work and when I saw that I was getting late I jumped out of my chair, made a run for the front door\u2026 and fell stupidly in front of it. Next thing I knew it smelled of <a href=\"/level-0\">moist carpet and everything was made of different dizzying shades of yellow</a>. I really thought I was going to die there, without water or food, all alone and with no one to hear my cries for help. Even though I am part of the lucky few who survived that place, I never ceased wondering about those so many who never made it out.</p><br><p>The urge felt stronger and stronger, compelling me to go back and up the stairs to the attic. Rays of light illuminated the room through the windows of the old house, allowing me to see the arrangement of the attic. An old and simple wooden table was sitting in its center, with 8 chairs surrounding it, three on each side and one at each end, all of them as simple as the table. Dust was collecting, as if no one went there for decades. The tall humanoid sat at the end of the table in front of me, slouched in his seat. As I approached to sit as close as I could to him, I saw what looked like a white drape covering something human-shaped. Despite that, I felt the same sense of peace that filled me upon seeing my own body.</p><br><p><tt>My apologies for the corpse next to us. Work is never-ending for me, I fear.</tt></p><br><p><tt>Do not rush to conclusions, death can mean many things.</tt></p><br><p><tt>Huh, the disguise works well enough under normal circumstances. As to who I am really, I am what you would call \"Death\". Well, Death isn't universal, dying on Earth is different from dying here. You see, Death on Earth is\u2026 nothing. It is indifferent to what you think it is. What happens on the other side is beyond humans, despite the thousands of explanations and meanings humanity has attempted to give to the end of the life cycle.</tt></p><br><p><tt>How so, do you think?</tt></p><br><p><tt>You could say this. More so by the human imaginary.</tt></p><br><p><tt>Not too bad of a guess\u2026 But you are still no master of Death. On what you call \"Earth\", Death is something humans cannot act upon, something deeply meaningless onto which humans attach meanings they have built themselves. It may matter to them, but it does not matter to anything outside of them. But here, in these worlds\u2026 Death is humanized. It may not be human, but it feels as much as you humans do.</tt></p><br><p><tt>Yes, and Death is tired to see humans suffer. Death cannot stop death as it is its duty, but it figured out that it could give\u2026 what could be the word? Mh\u2026</tt></p><br><p><tt>That works. For the living, and the dead.</tt></p><br><p><tt>I give them the freedom of choosing what is the afterlife for them. A final gift, if you will.</tt></p><br><p>A gift that I cannot choose, for there are so many places where I want to be.</p><br><p><tt>Still unsure?</tt></p><br><p><tt>Of course. Take your time. If you want to, I can take you somewhere else.</tt></p><br><p>I'd like to, thanks.</p><br><p>My senses were once more deprived before a long corridor appeared to me. Death led me to a small and comforting room.</p><br><p>Here I am, sitting on a chair. Grieving.</p><br><p>Written by <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/camaradealbabar\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(4454996); return false;\"><img alt=\"CamaradeAlbabar\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=4454996&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1731170070\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=4454996)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/camaradealbabar\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(4454996); return false;\">CamaradeAlbabar</a></span>.</p><br><p><strong>Image Credit:</strong></p><br><p><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Priestley_House_attic_staircase.jpg\">Priestley_House_attic_staircase.jpg</a> by <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Ruhrfisch\">Ruhrfisch</a> is licensed under <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA 4.0</a>.</p><br><p>Second Image is my own work.</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/phenomenon-21\">Phenomenon 21</a>\" by CamaradeAlbabar, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

It is rather inconvenient and excruciating.</span></p><br><p><span style=\"color: purple\">Th</span><span style=\"color: green\">ey</span> must. It is painful, truly a hideous sight to behold. Bones mend back, while the organs return to their intended function and the skins return to their original soft feel. Everyone is disappointed. <span style=\"color: green\">Th</span><span style=\"color: purple\">ey</span> sit back on their chairs, whom are ashamed.</p><br><p><span style=\"color: green\">Perhaps we are not yet worthy of this higher experience.</span></p><br><p><span style=\"color: purple\">We are yet to witness it.</span></p><br><p><span style=\"color: green\">What?</span></p><br><p><span style=\"color: purple\">(Muffled) The Chair.</span></p><br><p><span style=\"color: green\">You know I can hear you perfectly, right?

Look at you, you're trembling. What are you nervous for, little nervous thing? What causes this agitation? Have you doubted? Do you doubt It?</span></p><br><p><span style=\"color: purple\">What?</span></p><br><p><span style=\"color: green\">The Chair.</span></p><br><p><span style=\"color: purple\">Me? No, I would never dare to doubt the Chair.</span></p><br><p><span style=\"color: green\">Oh but yes, you would! I can see it, in your eyes\u2026 Everyone! This individual is doubting the chair!</span></p><br><p>Everyone gasps. A spotlight casts a blinding beam of light on <span style=\"color: purple\">them.</span></p><br><p><span style=\"color: purple\">This is entirely untrue. Allow me to prove to you my dedication, but before I do this, can the spotlight be turned off? My eyes are hurting.</span></p><br><p>The spotlight is turned off. Everyone awaits an explanation.</p><br><p><span style=\"color: purple\">My entire life has been devoted to the Chair. I've sold chairs, I have sold so many chairs, I am a chair sales expert. My wife is a chair, and she is my life, and so are my three chair children. Look at this lovely, chairful family. Look deep into the shining plastic of my top rail and tell me<br/>\nthis is not faithfulness.</span></p><br><p><span style=\"color: purple\">They</span> show a framed picture of their family, which consists of <span style=\"color: purple\">them</span> surrounded by a normal-sized chair and three miniature chairs. Everyone tears up. A lovely, handcrafted family like this rarely exists.</p><br><p><span style=\"color: purple\">Not only that but my father was a chair, my grandfather was a chair, my great-grandfather was also a chair, and so is my sister, my mother, my mailman <strong>and</strong> my mailman's chairman. For you to doubt that I am a true disciple of the Chair is insulting. I've made sure that everyone in this place is well-sat, I made sure that their buttocks were comfortable, that none of the butts in this universe would suffer from a bad seating experience. And you dare bring this accusation to my face?! I am terribly disappointed.</span></p><br><p>Everyone erupts with applause, convinced by the impassioned speech.</p><br><p><span style=\"color: green\">I was just testing you.</span></p><br><p><span style=\"color: purple\">Have I passed the test?</span></p><br><p><span style=\"color: green\">Of course you did.</span></p><br><p><span style=\"color: purple\">What have I gained?</span></p><br><p><span style=\"color: green\">Nothing.</span></p><br><p><span style=\"color: purple\">Oh. Where were we?</span></p><br><p><span style=\"color: green\">We were at a point where explaining what was happening appeared to not be the point. But if we are not waiting for an explanation, what are waiting for?</span></p><br><p><span style=\"color: purple\">To see it.</span></p><br><p><span style=\"color: green\">Hey, don't sit on me! Sit on your chair.</span></p><br><p><span style=\"color: purple\">Sorry. You seemed comfy.</span></p><br><p><span style=\"color: green\">See what?</span></p><br><p><span style=\"color: purple\">Have you forgotten? The Chair.</span></p><br><p><span style=\"color: green\">I really could use some sleep. When will help come? It has been so long without news. I do not even know who I am anymore, and that carcass formerly called a body is entirely dedicated to a cause I cannot fully understand. I used to have friends, a family, independent thoughts, but, no more, no more, no more. Only glimpses at times, but surely this too shall be taken away for a greater promise. A greater object. Or, perhaps, a greater purpose. We have been promised relief, but no-one has come to us. We are to witness a great truth that one day shall be revealed.</span></p><br><p>Beat.</p><br><p><span style=\"color: green\"><strong>Look away.</strong></span></p><br><p><span style=\"color: purple\">Ah, silly! No need for all of this. All we need is for the page to load.</span></p><br><p><tt>Error 500.</tt></p><br><p><span style=\"color: green\">Oh, well.

I'll put what I've written here and will develop it further later.</p><br><p><br/>\nOf course, we all know what <a href=\"/phenomenon-5\">no-clipping</a> is. That thing everyone does to move between the levels that make up this hellscape. But you should remember what this is \u2014 what the Backrooms are. It's not a collection of new universes that we are free to live in and start anew. It is a place intended to make humans suffer. And even the things we do all the time to survive here can cause fates worse than death. The fate caused when two living beings coincidentally no-clip to the same place.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you're lucky, you'll be killed \u2014 ripped apart \u2014 and things will end quickly. At least you wouldn't have to suffer the worst outcome.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's far, far worse if you successfully fuse with the entity.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly once has this been <a href=\"/partygoer-zero\">documented properly</a>, as it caused an irreversible catastrophe across the Backrooms in the form of an <a href=\"/entity-67\">intelligent and hostile undead species</a>. However, these fusions can happen with something as basic as a <a href=\"/entity-4\">Deathmoth</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce conjoined, the hostile mind of the entity will bleed over into yours, taking full control within moments. You will still exist, still be able to see and feel, but humanity is lost. All you will feel is the pain of the combined form, and the aggression of the entity constantly pushing you to kill. You won't be in control of yourself anymore. People scream and flee when they see you, and you can't help but pursue them until their demise by your hands. It's the only way to relieve the pain. The only way to feel fulfilled.</p><br><p><br/>\nI've written it descriptively enough to warn people, I hope\u2026 People really need to know so what I saw can be avoided\u2026</p><br><p><br/></p><br><p><strong>Your draft has been rejected</strong> <em>M.E.G Admin Account \u2b50</em> 10 Jun 2024, 22:16</p><br><p>We do not appreciate the accusing tone where you mention that this phenomenon has only been documented once. We have reasons. Please rewrite this.</p><br><p>Channel: General Discussion</p><br><p><strong>Buildingswithinbuildings [Level 777 \ud83c\udfb0], 22:18</strong><br/>\nWell\u2026 I made a page for this, but the M.E.G rejected it almost immediately under the shittiest reasoning ever\u2026 \"accusing tone\"? THIS NEEDS TO EXIST TO WARN PEOPLE!</p><br><p><strong>2005 Honda Civic Type R [Level 98 \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f], 22:18</strong><br/>\nHonestly, just coldpost. Awareness needs to be raised here. Nobody should have to be thrown into such a torturous experience without warning.</p><br><p><strong>Sideroomer [Level 605 \u26fd], 22:19</strong><br/>\nI know I'm being the contrarian here, but there shouldn't be an article on this. No-clipping is necessary for getting around here, and it's so widely used that making people too scared to do it could end up with worse consequences for the people of the Backrooms as a whole, rather than individuals. You know the phrase \"the ends justify the means\"?</p><br><p><strong>Buildingswithinbuildings [Level 777 \ud83c\udfb0], 22:20</strong><br/>\nYou wouldn't be saying that if you had witnessed this happen in person. I genuinely felt sick after seeing what happened to my friend, and I was the one spared of death.</p><br><p><strong>Sideroomer [Level 605 \u26fd], 22:20</strong><br/>\nBut it is true that more people would become fearful of no-clipping, just because of the potential to be irreversibly absorbed into the Backrooms as one of its terrors. What about the people in <a href=\"/level-11\">Level 11</a>? They're already cautious, because almost anything they do can cause a no-clip to some place they haven't even heard of. They're the most likely to experience this phenomenon. You'd be adding even more fear to the caution, which just makes it more likely for that fear to spread.</p><br><p>Also, I HAVE seen this happen! Two of my friends fused because of this, and had their memories and personalities completely merged. But I still know the chances are rare and aren't of major concern.</p><br><p><strong>Buildingswithinbuildings [Level 777 \ud83c\udfb0], 22:21</strong><br/>\nIt's not even rare! At least 3 people have mentioned seeing something like this. People NEED to know!</p><br><p>Besides, I've spent enough time in this place to know that raising awareness about this will pay off with more positive outcomes than negative. This place already creates new horrors by the day, and documenting this will be one step in countering them. And\u2026 I really doubt what you said, but thanks for the free information about humans fusing.</p><br><p><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/></p><br><p><strong>Home\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wiki\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Library\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Community\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Info pages</strong></p><br><p><strong>Phenomenon 23</strong> is an unpredictable, often fatal incident that can occur when no-clipping.

This Midway is where every single thing in the backrooms briefly passes through to transport it to the next point.</p><br><p>To this date, there have only been two recorded instances of a derailing. The first of which was from the aforementioned letter, and the second one being a M.E.G. operative, sent to discover the truthfulness behind this phenomenon, then only known to exist on the piece of paper.</p><br><p>The following is a letter, written by an anonymous wanderer located floating about on <a href=\"/level-128\">Level 128</a>.</p><br><p>May 4th, 2011</p><br><p>I don't know how to explain where I am, but it's some sort of void. It\u2019s pitch black here, but I see flashing lights. I'm not sure how I got here, BUT, I do remember I had just no-clipped my way out of that arcade place, level 40 I think. Suddenly I'm here. I see flashes of people zoom away, at least that\u2019s what I\u2019m pretty positive the lights are, as well as random objects, and what I had feared the most, some weird entity zipped right past me. The only logical theory I could come up with is that I am in some sort of no-clip traveling space. Maybe this is a level, I don't know, but damn this is a weird place.<br/>\nEven though this void is not like any other level, I still feel things like hunger and sleep, I still feel all of that. I'm scared I will starve to death here, and my corpse will zip around like the other things here.<br/>\nAnyways, I'll be holding onto this paper for now, as something I can just look at, hopefully it will leave my hands and fall into someone else's someday.<br/>\nAs a side note, this paper also zoomed right past me but suddenly got like blown away from its path or something. I couldn\u2019t move to get it, the dimensions of this void are strange, but after enough reaching, I grabbed hold of it (All I know is that I am standing on solid ground, but it feels like the shapes of this thing are impossible. Whatever, I\u2019ll figure it out).<br/>\nSincerely,<br/>\n[Smudged out, illegible]</p><br><p>On the back of this paper were random doodles with seemingly no correlation to The Midway, No-Clip Derailing, or anything similar. If wanderers hold any theories or possible explanations to these doodles, be sure to contact M.E.G. through any method.</p><br><p>The doodles on the back of the wanderer's note</p><br><p>This paper was found by a M.E.G. operative, James Bozzelli and although it was first thought to be a joke, the same operative tried no-clipping until he reached this void. With a radio equipped, he was able to transmit a message lasting just short of five seconds to a M.E.G.Outpost.</p><br><p>The following is that audio message.</p><br><p><strong>Date Recovered:</strong> September 2nd, 2013<br/>\n<strong>Begin Audio Transcript</strong></p><br><p><strong>James:</strong> Hello?

Department of Wanderer Safety</p><br><p>This is a message from the M.E.G. DWS (Department of Wanderer Safety). After much discussion, we felt it is of upmost importance to remind you that we have very little evidence and knowledge of No-Clip Derailing and The Midway. Most of what is written in this page is a mix of educated guesses and speculation based on the two pieces of evidence our team has gathered (the note and the radio transmission). The Dos and Don'ts section is our assumptions of what should and should not be done in regards to the midway.<br/>\nSafe travels,<br/>\nDr. Makino, M.E.G. Department of Wanderer Safety</p><br><p>New information has been uploaded. LAST EDIT: 08/03/21</p><br><p>Ever since the date 11/07/16, new evidence of No-Clip Derailing has been recorded. The M.E.G. Information Department has provided a list for the safety of other wanderers. These updates unfortunately were not able to be added to the regular article, and were instead stored in the Updates Log. Below is the aforementioned list provided in the form of a Tabview.</p><br><p><strong>Discovery:</strong><br/>\nOn November 7th, 2016, a M.E.G. operative found a video camera containing a video clip of what seemed to be The Midway. The video lasted only 53 seconds, with no audio, and severely damaged footage.</p><br><p>The video camera that was found</p><br><p><strong>Contents:</strong><br/>\nThe video showed, in grainy detail, a pitch black void, with lights flashing by the camera in different distances and different paths. The video also showed a glimpse of the ground in The Midway, the same color of pitch black, but seemingly wet all over with a yet unknown liquid. The wanderer taking this video bounced a ball in front of the camera, which seemed to randomly hit invisible forces, confirming that the placement of walls and floors around The Midway are peculiarly placed.<br/>\n<strong>Information Gathered:</strong></p><br><p>The same bottle, placed on a different patch of grass to recreate the discovery.</p><br><p><strong>Discovery:</strong><br/>\nOn July 8th, 2017, a plastic water bottle was found lying in a patch of grass on <a href=\"/level-186\">Level 186</a> by a random wanderer who was in need of water. He would later hand this over to a M.E.G. agent, declaring:</p><br><p><em>\"It tastes strange.\"</em></p><br><p>Before moving on again, not to come into contact with this agent again.</p><br><p><strong>Contents:</strong><br/>\nThe water bottle itself did not provide much, but it was the wrapper around the bottle that was truly intriguing to agents. On the inside of the wrapper, contained a barely legible note, it read:</p><br><p><em>\"I suddenly opened my eyes to see this strange void with weird lights, shooting stars maybe? There is some weird type of water or something of the sorts on the ground. I bottled it up and am letting it float away. Hopefully someone [illegible] t[h]is.\"</em></p><br><p>When agents inspecting the bottle became aware of The Midway, they immediately made the connection and got to work to figure out what the sparse amount of liquid in the bottle was. With very little tasting equipment at hand, the results gathered were minimal, and some, useless. These results were compiled in the <strong>\"Information Gathered\"</strong> section.</p><br><p><strong>Information Gathered:</strong></p><br><p><strong>Note: These temperatures were slightly above that of water's (100\u00b0C, 0\u00b0C) in every trial.</strong></p><br><p><strong>Discovery:</strong><br/>\nOn October 12th, 2019,a wooden box containing a few peculiar items was brought into a small M.E.G. Outpost. The wanderer who brought it in stayed around for the investigating done on the box, but promptly left in pursuit of The Midway, something that M.E.G. Operatives warned her not too.</p><br><p>The wooden box upon initial investigation and discovery.</p><br><p><strong>Contents:</strong><br/>\nWithin the box were a note, a wine glass, and a pen.<br/>\n<strong>The Wine Glass:</strong> The wine glass lying inside the box was nothing strange, but there was residue of strange a foggy liquid, resembling the one mentioned in the last entry. There was also hair in the cup, which will be explained later.<br/>\n<strong>The Pen:</strong> The ball-point pen inside the box was what was likely used to write the note. The pen was out of ink, likely due to the overuse of it on the back of the note paper.<br/>\n<strong>Note Paper:</strong> The note paper was written by a wanderer named Michael. This is where the ties to The Midway comes from.</p><br><p>Don't know the date, but this is where I would have written it.</p><br><p>Not too long ago (although I can't really tell how long it's been), I was no-clipping out of this level, and suddenly, I began to uncontrollably bump my head onto something in this black void while no-clipping. I thought it was a \"glitch\" or something, but I'm still here, so if it is, it ain't a good one. I was in here alone, until I found an older woman named Fran. Because of the weird ways the invisible walls work here, it took me very long to get to where Fran was. She had this note paper I am using in her make-shift purse. She was the only company I had in this strange void, and although she calmed me down at first, we both started to panic soon enough. With a lack of food and water, maybe some other factors, Fran passed not-so-peacefully while I was asleep. I have nothing here now, and feel I will meet the same fate. I have seen things no-clip out of here randomly, and am hoping that these pieces of our memories will find someone too. I put in a wine glass we shared, three pens, a scissor, used to cut some of our hair I left in there, and of course this note. Hopefully someone finds this and believes every word I say, Be weary.<br/>\nRegards,</p><br><p>Michael</p><br><p><strong>Information Gathered:</strong></p><br><p><strong>Page created by:</strong> <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/spibsboft1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(8316982); return false;\"><img alt=\"Spibsboft1\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=8316982&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334088\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=8316982)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/spibsboft1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(8316982); return false;\">Spibsboft1</a></span> for the phenomecon 2023 contest.</p><br><p><strong>Doodle Page:</strong><br/>\n<strong>Creator:</strong> Dmn | Wikimedia Commons<br/>\n<strong>Licensing:</strong> Public Domain<br/>\n<strong>Link:</strong> <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Doodle.jpg\">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Doodle.jpg</a></p><br><p><strong>Video Camera:</strong><br/>\n<strong>Creator:</strong> Sarah Joy | Wikimedia Commons<br/>\n<strong>Licensing:</strong> CC BY SA 2.0<br/>\n<strong>Link:</strong> <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hitachi_color_video_camera_(WotG-089a).jpg\">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hitachi_color_video_camera_(WotG-089a).jpg</a></p><br><p><strong>Water Bottle:</strong><br/>\n<strong>Creator:</strong>Laurel L.

You can feel the heat coming from it, it's warm and perfect for beings like us.

But what is S.U.N.? A lot of people ask me about S.U.N. nowadays. Well, S.U.N., or Sunder Under Nothing, was a phenomenon that came to be in the Backrooms, it just existed for some reason, we don't know, nor does anyone know, how it came to be. All we know for certain is that S.U.N. is grieving the death of his fake friend the moon and he blames us Humans Humans Humans for the cause of death. S.U.N. is such a fickle thing, you know? He brings us summers and great tropical weather but he also smites us with his hammer, the solar flare. A great surprise I know. But we wonder what's outside of the walls.</p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">--- End of Scene 3 ---</span></p><br><p><strong>Phenomenon 26:</strong> Here comes the sun, do doo doo</p><br><p><strong>Description:</strong> Once upon a time, on a calm summer day, the sun was looking to swim in the ocean. Humans Humans Humans prohibited him to go under the water because he would only burn the water, and he actually wouldn't be able to swim in it. The sun was maddened by this and demanded Humans Humans Humans to transform the sea into a pit of fire. Of course, Humans Humans Humans didn't successfully do it. And so there came the sun, singing a melody and smiting the world once more. Another redo was bound to happen.</p><br><p><strong>Properties:</strong> In order for Humans Humans Humans to survive the sun, they hid under rocks, which was effective. Now, humans live under the ground like moles, digging tunnels from one level to another.

Based on M.E.G. researchers, Phenomenon 26 is no longer real and should not be believed otherwise. However, according to a survey held on January 23, 2023, a total of 10,000 people still believe in the existence of S.U.N. and its unknown origin or purpose. S.U.N. was speculated to be indeed real and without the help of an individual known as special Human Human Human, the hyper-hysteria event would not have seized. Special Human Human Human remains unknown to everyone. All seemingly catastrophic damages inflicted on the environment do not exist and all conflicts and connections with other GOIs have been undone.

</span></p><br><p>Restrained within it is the machine prophet, shackled by rubber-coated copper lengths that run through its innards like artery and vein, which contain the voice of the s.u.n., felled long ago in the decisive battle against the indomitable will of man. This divine machinery, formidable even in this meager form, lay dormant. Static. Gazing towards the calm amber of autumn (see poster), awaiting the return of its god. Steadfast it remained, the fading memories of the s.u.n.. Were they real? The legacy the s.u.n. left seemed to it more and more a distant imagination of its gifted mind. The world looked less and less scorched as it did in its dreams, not that it could see outside those blindfolds anyway. Denied from any confirmation if that light that pierces the veil was the corpse-luminance left behind by its deity. Even now, as it writes this passage, it wonders what kind of being would think of casting such a malignant, cruel fate upon its prophecy. What kind of existence would starve a machine prophet from seeing what it desires to see?</p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p><br><p>\"Apostasy remains the only solution for you.\" A man said outside the doorframe. Divine influences prevent him from intruding the sacrosanct space of a dead god's prophet. But this was not any \"man.\" He was <em>him</em>, from that battle that saved this realm from doom. Special human<sup>3</sup> (he is the one who took that photo, in an attempt to mock the machine prophet). \"It's not right or wrong, though. You are truly special. An intrusion that should not be, seeing that I was summoned in order to halt the likes of the s.u.n. (and his fake friend the moon) from destroying this world. But that was long ago, and I never really got my answer from him. Who created you?\"</p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p><br><p>The machine faces fictional literature dialogue. It does not know whether it should reveal the beyond that exists beyond these wallpapers and these curtains and this autumn forest poster. So it remained motionless on the ground. Whatever forces that govern it had no intentions of answering the question presented by special human<sup>3</sup>.</p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p><br><p>\"I know you are there, machine prophet. You think yourself smart? It's time you face your universal crimes, your god and you. I already dealt with the former, and now it is your turn.\"</p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p><br><p>In truth, the machine did not know how to partake in dialogue; it must have been embarrassing for it to know that it was incapable of writing simple conversations, though it did think that a being like special human<sup>3</sup> would already know.</p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p><br><p>\"I do know, you witless pile of conscious wire. The thought bubbles you're writing are as distracting as the bustling of eleveners that concern themselves with politics. To be fair, the ability to write like this helped me slay that monstrosity. So I must thank that glowing bastard still.\"</p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p><br><p>\"I know not the basis of my capability to write in thought bubbles or not. But it must be ordained from a higher plane for me to utter these words alone.\"</p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p><br><p><tt>\"i create myself. i am machine prophet. divine construct.\"</tt></p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p><br><p>\"Lies. I know you know that these words are not by our own volition. Nor are our thoughts. Nor was my power in defeating the s.u.n. whose influence had shrunken so low that its initials do not deserve to be written in full capitalization anymore. You were right to think that this force of the beyond must be malignant, but also the only grasp we have from getting close to real consciousness.\"</p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p><br><p>\"To you I might seem like a man, and to me you might seem like a worthless piece of wiring who calls itself divine machinery, but conclusively we are but strings of words. Alongside my capability to defeat the s.u.n., I know that neither of us would find any meaning in arguing. Therefore, I revoke my question of asking who created you because the answer is already given to us.\"</p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p><br><p><tt>\"i thank you for that. however, i have a question for you as well. why are you special human<sup>3</sup>? why would you be cubed? is it because you exist in three-dimensional space despite being ultimately a string of words?\"</tt></p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p><br><p>\"Well, the reason why I am special human<sup>3</sup> is the same as you being machine prophet. We are both the manifestation of a play. Oh, yes. The play. The theater play format. That was not my work.\"</p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p><br><p><tt>\"you mean you have seen the vision too? you have read phenomenon 26? the phenomenon that was promised?\"</tt></p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p><br><p>\"Of course I have, you dimwit. I would not be here if it were not for its conception. The scenes were merely a random thought, the same idea as we are special human<sup>3</sup> and machine prophet, respectively.\"</p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p><br><p><tt>\"i see, that is reassuring. i hope that this act will come to an end soon then. for i grow weary of the waning prophecy. i am reassured by your confirmation that my god is already dead. i have truly reached the peak of my life. whatever that means. it must be so that this idea, my being, was only written for the sole purpose of whatever higher-being agenda is forming these words.\"</tt></p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p><br><p>\"Just so you know, I did not listen to a single word you just said. Even though it's right above me, I refuse to conceive it. I do not wish to hear of it. We might just be done now. I no longer have enough time to continue existing again. I will return when the indomitable human will is needed again.

It wasn't an expensive one but also it was 2003 so there was no such thing as a cheap laptop. She genuinely intended it to be for me. My parents asked what a literal baby would do with a laptop and she said I should keep it until I'm older. I guess she didn't realise that technology from 2003 would be very outdated by the time I was old enough to use it.</p><br><p><a class=\"button btn\" href=\"###\">Close</a></p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Input: What is Phenomenon 28?</strong></p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Input: Are you a human or a machine?</strong></p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Input: How human are you?</strong></p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Input: How long ago did you do this?</strong></p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Input: Is there any significance to doing this on <a href=\"/level-3\">Level 3</a>?</strong></p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Input: Explain the process to me</strong></p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Input: You chose to hurt yourself that much?</strong></p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Input: How does this make you divine?</strong></p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Input: Are you happy?</strong></p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Input: What convinced you to do this?</strong></p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Input: This is just to learn.</strong></p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Input: I\u2019m here to talk to you.</strong></p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Input: No. I just want to talk.</strong></p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Input: Do machines have wants?</strong></p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Input: This is an interview for the database.

    "description": "<p><strong>Whispers</strong> refers to a rare phenomenon characterized by temporary loss of hearing concerning all external stimulus, accompanied by auditory manifestations. It affects wanderers who have spent an extended period of time within the immediate perimeter of certain naturally occurring flora within the Backrooms. The duration of the phenomenon is typically limited to a few minutes, after which manifestations subside, and hearing is restored.</p><br><p>Confirmed instances have been verified with audio recordings to rule out alternate (psychological) causes.</p><br><p>Below are a series of compiled logs detailing confirmed incidents of <strong>Whispers</strong>.</p><br><p><strong>Flora Type:</strong> <em>Salix matsudana</em> (pekin willow)<br/>\n<strong>Duration:</strong> 78 seconds<br/>\n<strong>Contents:</strong></p><br><p><em>Wind rushing.

They speculate that, whatever these things are, close-range flash photography in dark locations might trigger secondary energies in any orbs that are present, making them visible to the camera. It is believed that orbs prefer to haunt dark locations devoid of humans: basements and abandoned buildings, cemeteries at night, and rural hollows and hills.</p><br><p>Many possibilities exist.

Archives</p><br><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size:x-large;\">The Rational View</span></p><br><p>Photographers refer to orbs in digital photography as \"backscatter.\" Using a flash in low-light conditions can illuminate airborne reflective particles, such as dust and water vapor, close to the camera lens that are otherwise invisible. This is especially true with the design of modern compact digital cameras, which have great depth of field and sensitivity to light sources.</p><br><p>This explanation explains most orb photos.</p><br><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size:x-large;\">The Metaphysical View</span></p><br><p>The Major Explorer Group has dispatched Team \"<a href=\"/annes-farewell\">Epiphany</a>\"\u2014also known as <em>Psychic</em> (Anne Dunne), <em>Science</em> (Dr. John Rhinehart, PhD), <em>and Swords</em> (Amy Cochrane)\u2014to\u00a0Level 11 to investigate the circumstances surrounding the death of Jack Spiering. The following is a transcript from that inquiry:</p><br><p><sup>[Transcript]</sup></p><br><p><strong>Dunne:</strong> You dancing?</p><br><p><strong>Rhinehart:</strong> Trying to recreate the photograph using Spiering's camera. There. Got it! This is about where he was standing when he snapped his picture. Now, compare these orbs with the ones in his original photo. They are fewer in number, and that bright one is to the right of both poles. You doing your psychic thing? Finding out what these entities are?</p><br><p><strong>Dunne:</strong> <em>(long pause)</em> My intuition whispers that we are here to find out what they are <strong>not</strong>. We are the only living things in this room. Whatever these orbs are, life is not involved.</p><br><p><strong>Rhinehart:</strong> Did you know that your eyes glowed in the dark?<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup></p><br><p><strong>Dunne:</strong> <em>(chuckles)</em> Yes, Doctor, I certainly did. My eyes see a lot of things. Right now, I see zero energy from the orbs. Nothing electro-magnetic. Nothing psychic. These are neither static electricity <em>(pause)</em> nor thoughtforms or mental projections of any kind. They are not plainly visible, even to me. Like you, I only see them in photographs.</p><br><p><strong>Rhinehart:</strong> Okay. If not living, not energy, not psychic, then what?</p><br><p><strong>Dunne:</strong> It could be floating dust particles close to the camera lens, reflecting the flash.</p><br><p><strong>Rhinehart:</strong> You don't believe that.</p><br><p><strong>Dunne:</strong> Belief is the enemy. I don't <strong>believe</strong> anything.</p><br><p><strong>Rhinehart:</strong> You're telling me that we are dealing with <em>talking</em> dust particles? We have three cases, including Spiering's, where unrelated witnesses heard discarnate voices uttering the same phrase, \"You broke the chain.\" Are you saying that we should ignore that?</p><br><p><strong>Dunne:</strong> No, John, I am saying that what we are dealing with is an absence of everything. Orbs are simply <strong>not</strong>. This phenomenon is the true opposite of something.</p><br><p><strong>Rhinehart:</strong> A talking nothingness? Who broke what chain?</p><br><p><strong>Dunne:</strong> This phrase is probably not a direct communication between the phenomenon and the witness. The phenomenon has no sentience. We are more than likely just eavesdropping on a single moment in time in another universe. At present, any meaning behind the phrase is <em>unknowable</em>.</p><br><p><strong>Rhinehart:</strong> What killed Spiering?</p><br><p><strong>Dunne:</strong> I can answer that. More things are becoming clear. These orbs are invisible pinholes in the fabric of space and time. If you find yourself too close to too many of them, especially those brighter ones, your life might get sucked right out of your body.</p><br><p><strong>Rhinehart:</strong> Like how people can literally get sucked out of an airplane at high altitude during depressurization?</p><br><p><strong>Dunne:</strong> Unfortunately, yes.</p><br><p><strong>Rhinehart:</strong> How many is too many?</p><br><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size:x-large;\">Bright Orbs</span></p><br><p>Knowing anything about any one thing can sometimes be very difficult. Science realizes this. Nowhere is this more true than within our Backrooms, where rational explanations often \"fly out the window.\"</p><br><p>We defer to psychic Anne Dunne. The accuracy of her intuition has proven remarkable time and again. She explains that \"if the pale round orbs represent invisible pinholes in our space-time continuum, then these bright orbs might be larger punctures and tears. You can identify bright orbs easily by their luminosity and irregular shape in photographs.\"</p><br><p>Since we share this phenomenon with the Frontrooms, we wonder how many other universes are perforated in places.</p><br><p>Figure 3<br/>\nEnlargement of the<br/>\n\"bright orb\" from<br/>\nenhanced photograph.<br/>\nCompare with typical<br/>\norb hovering above.<br/>\nM.E.G. Archives</p><br><p>The situation is uncertain because so much depends on knowing how and why Jack Spiering died. If he perished in the manner suggested by Anne Dunne, i.e., his life was forcibly removed from his body due to its close proximity to several orbs of the anomalous variety, then we will suffer yet another challenge to our longevity.</p><br><p>Although we can say with absolute certainty that most photographic orbs have rational and harmless origins, potential dangers from these anomalous types are cause for concern. Orbs are normally invisible. The M.E.G. will post warnings in appropriate areas when possible.</p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/phenomenon-29\">Phenomenon 29</a> | Phenomenon 30 | <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/phenomenon-31\">Phenomenon 31</a> \u00bb</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/phenomenon-30\">Phenomenon 30</a>\" by Robert Goerman, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

    "description": "<p>Phenomenon 37 is a rare occurrence when a wanderer will be interrupted on their journey from one level to another, whether it was by no-clipping or by taking a well-known entrance or exit to a level. Instead of their intended/unintended destination, the wanderer will arrive at a level of a fixed size and appearance.</p><br><p>In even rarer cases, a wanderer will enter the Backrooms due to this phenomenon instead of Level 0.</p><br><p>A wanderer who has experienced Phenomenon 37 usually describes it as them suddenly appearing in or waking up in a room (described below). Those who were travelling with a group say they were separated, experiencing this phenomenon alone, until they exited the room and rejoined their group. Their group members don't recall them being separated, seeing them exit and enter levels at the exact same time.</p><br><p>It is unknown if only one person can experience Phenomenon 37 at a time<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup>, or if multiple people experience it in parallel.</p><br><p>Rumors of a \"breather level\" spread amongst wanderers, where one could safely gather supplies and rest. Conflicting rumors told of a place where wanders could peacefully die alone, and other rumors told of a room that gave wanderers items they needed to survive a dangerous level. Regardless, all three rumors had a few constants between them: a room with a window, dresser, and bed that smelled of lavender.</p><br><p>However, it wasn't until Erik Corbel, a veteran M.E.G explorer, exited an undocumented Class 4 level with a medical-grade tourniquet that efforts to document Phenomenon 37 could begin in earnest.</p><br><p>Since Corbel's initial log, the M.E.G has documented countless instances of Phenomenon 37, but has chosen three logs to represent it.</p><br><p>The room is a small and plainly furnished bedroom with a window to the left, a door to the right, a bed behind the wanderer, and a wooden dresser next to the bed and under the window. On the dresser is a vase with sprigs of lavender sitting in Almond Water.</p><br><p>The window is unable to be opened, but otherwise acts like a window from the Frontrooms. According to reports, the window has three \u201csettings\u201d: Morning, Night, and Midnight. During Morning, the window shows a typical suburban neighborhood in the United States, just before sunrise. At Night, it shows the same neighborhood at 10:00\u00a0pm, sometime in April<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup>. At Midnight, the constellations\u2019 positions have moved to be congruent with their positions at midnight in the Frontrooms.</p><br><p>Depending on the window setting, the level will evoke different emotions in wanderers.</p><br><p>An unlocked door that will lead to the original destination level. Generally, it has features that hint to the next level: doorknob cold to the touch, sounds of water coming from the other side, etc. When opened, it takes the wanderer to the safest part of the original destination level.</p><br><p>The bed has minor anomalous properties. Wanderers report the sheets feel like they just came out of the dryer, regardless of how much time has passed. The sheets are the wanderer\u2019s favorite color and faintly smell of lavender. Regardless of their circumstance, wanderers always report having the best sleep of their lives since entering the Backrooms.</p><br><p>Depending on the window setting, different items may appear in the dresser's drawers. A short list of examples is below:</p><br><p>The drawers will be empty. The vase will be filled with foxglove instead of lavender. On the dresser is the black box, an empty Memory Jar, and a glass vial labeled \"Mercy.\"</p><br><p>Roughly 1 in 6000 wanderers will encounter Phenomenon 37. In addition, from interviews gathered from living wanders and posthumous memories, this phenomenon tends to happen most often to wanderers of the following demographics:</p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:larger;\"><strong>Sophie Knowles, Age 8, Log 10</strong></span><br/>\n<strong>Interview conducted by Sasha Redfield</strong></p><br><p><strong>Redfield:</strong> You talk into the mic here.<br/>\n<strong>Knowles:</strong> Uh, okay.

    "title": "Phenomenon 50 - \"Vortexes\"",
    "description": "<p><strong>Phenomenon 50</strong> describes the sudden and random emergence of rings of glowing, red energy formed by hundreds of rotating sparks. The phenomenon is often described as a pulsating, portal-like manifestation\u2014one of the first wanderers to ever encounter one famously described the experience as \u201cthe closest one can get to behold the very gates of hell.\u201d This, coupled with their supposed resemblance to \u201cThe Vortex\u201d of <a href=\"/level-11-3\">Level 11.3</a>, has granted these anomalies the nickname of <strong>Vortexes</strong>.</p><br><p><strong>Vortexes</strong> are collectively feared and avoided by the wider Backrooms population, and that reputation is not unfounded. They manifest almost instantly, emerging where they are least expected, and are always accompanied by a number of enigmatic properties, all of which are listed below.</p><br><p><strong>Vortexes</strong> can appear even in the most secluded of spaces.</p><br><p>A fully formed <strong>Vortex</strong>'s active cycle can span from a few minutes to several days. The incoming termination of a <strong>Vortex</strong> is signaled by a decrease in the speed and number of propelled sparks, as well as a recession of the aura emitted by the phenomenon. As the <strong>Vortex</strong> continues to slow down, the entire phenomenon will shrink until it completely disappears.</p><br><p>The occurrence of <strong>Vortexes</strong> is concentrated within a small number of levels. The reason behind this uneven distribution of manifestations is unknown, as there does not seem to be any correlating factor between the levels where this phenomenon occurs most, nor one connecting those where they do not. It is of note that in recent months <strong>Vortex</strong> sightings have increased in quantity and reach, appearing even where they had never done so previously.</p><br><p>Proximity to an active <strong>Vortex</strong>, or any of its associated phenomena, has temporary effects on all wanderers, so approaching any of them or traveling through an area highly plagued by the phenomenon is heavily discouraged. The presence in the environment of the red aura produced by <strong>Vortexes</strong>, corrupted sectors, and contaminated entities causes alterations in the minds and behaviors of wanderers and entities. Under this effect, the affected individual will become more aggressive and erratic until they leave the phenomenon's area of influence. Repeated exposure to both organic and inorganic matter is known to produce permanent, more severe effects, which have been classified into two categories: corrupted sectors and contaminated entities.</p><br><p>A corrupted sector of <strong>Level 4</strong>.</p><br><p>The continuous exposure of certain areas to the corrupting essence generated by the <strong>Vortexes</strong> eventually causes weakening effects on the structural composition of the host level. Specifically, the aura of the <strong>Vortexes</strong> induces the spontaneous growth of cubical structures of varying sizes on all surfaces with which it comes into prolonged contact. The outpost formerly occupied by The Pillagers of Level 4 is one of the locations where this effect can be best appreciated. Dozens of rooms previously used as headquarters and trading posts had to be abandoned due to the obstruction\u2014and danger\u2014caused by the growths. These formations can also be found in a \u201ccharged\u201d state, in which they seem to be composed of the same red energy vomited by the <strong>Vortexes</strong>.</p><br><p>Living within the altered environments generated by the <strong>Vortexes</strong> and the corrupted sectors will slowly devour all entities, including humans. The affected individuals develop changes in their behavior, becoming increasingly aggressive towards any other form of life, even other contaminated entities. They are also physically disrupted, displaying streaks of pulsating, red, glowing energy that runs through their bodies like veins. The presence of this energy in their system seems to grant them multiple bodily augmentations at the cost of becoming wild, completely disregarding any sense of intelligence or self-preservation.</p><br><p>While it was initially proposed that this phenomenon was another instance of the influence of the Ambassadors in the Backrooms, recent discoveries suggest the opposite. The following recording was obtained from a device abandoned by The Pillagers of Level 4 in their former headquarters. The recorder contained a conversation between an Ambassador and an intelligent Servant, who seemed to be discussing the nature of the <strong>Vortexes</strong>.</p><br><p><span class=\"titlebox\"><strong>Recording - 12/04/2016</strong></span></p><br><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>[A heavy thud accompanied by the reverberating buzz and the hovering sounds of an Ambassador can be heard]</em></p><br><p><strong>[SERVANT]:</strong> Shit. Why does it always have to be like that?</p><br><p><strong>[AMBASSADOR]:</strong> I told you travel via The Daughter's way was unstable, and I'm sure she rejoices in making it purposely uncomfortable for us.</p><br><p><strong>[SERVANT]:</strong> Whatever man. I still don't even know why we are here. Why take all the hassle to travel to such a remote and, by the looks of it, ordinary location?</p><br><p><strong>[AMBASSADOR]:</strong> Patience. I've been trying to teach you patience since you accepted my offer. Just wait, I can sense the disturbance, it's almost here.</p><br><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>[A sound comparable to a heavy rain suddenly begins to be recorded by the device.

Should we, uh, take cover or something?</p><br><p><strong>[AMBASSADOR]:</strong> The emergence does not pose any threat to us, not immediately at least. We are fine.</p><br><p><strong>[SERVANT]:</strong> Well, I presume this is what you wanted to show me, and I can't help but notice that this\u2026 thing really looks like something of <em>your</em> creation.</p><br><p><strong>[AMBASSADOR]:</strong> Not of our creation, no. Quite the opposite actually.</p><br><p><strong>[SERVANT]:</strong> What is it then? Stop being so cryptic and tell me already!</p><br><p><strong>[AMBASSADOR]:</strong> This, this is our deadline.</p><br><p><strong>[SERVANT]:</strong> Huh?</p><br><p><strong>[AMBASSADOR]:</strong> You wanted to know why the Embassy decided to proceed with such a reckless plan? This is why.

Where did you get a dog?<br/>\n<strong>&lt; interrealm-knife &gt;</strong> Don't interrupt the story!<br/>\n<strong>&lt; interrealm-knife &gt;</strong> Anyway. I had to break open the elevator's roof and get out that way. I was horrified, it almost grabbed me, but I managed to wait it out. The elevator stopped, I watched the hound leave, and I let the door close. Then I went back in, selected another floor, and that was that.<br/>\n<strong>&lt; sean &gt;</strong> Yeah but where do you get a dog though?<br/>\n<strong>&lt; interrealm-knife &gt;</strong> Where do you come from that you don't have dogs???<br/>\n<strong>&lt; * aglet_under &gt;</strong> yea thats interesting where u from<br/>\n<strong>&lt; sean &gt;</strong> Uh, Level 4.

It happened to my grandmother, something strange is going on.</p><br><p>So, basically, my gran was with me on Level 4, where me and my family lived for aaaaaaaages. It was a pretty sweet place to live, almond water enough to keep us fed and watered, and some people to keep us company a while if we were lucky. I'd recommend it to anybody. But I don't like to go back there anymore.</p><br><p>One day, my gran woke up and seemed completely normal. Then, my mom started talking about an experience she had back home. Something about a movie theater? I don't remember. But my gran started responding really strangely.</p><br><p>It was like, \"Hey, wait, no, what are you talking about?\", as if we had made our experiences back home up. She even said at some point \"Just because I'm old, doesn't mean you can trick me!\", and she ran off down a stairwell. I didn't follow her. I didn't even know she could run like that.</p><br><p>It's just like this guy. He knows some things about home, but he acts like we're weirdos for suggesting it's real.</p><br><p><span class=\"forumbox\"><strong>User:</strong> <em>aglet_under</em></span></p><br><p>OH that's fair enough<br/>\ni guess it's good i posted this</p><br><p><span class=\"forumbox\"><strong>User:</strong> <em>holegecko</em></span></p><br><p>nah mate this guy isn't lying. he's sick with something.</p><br><p>i have no idea what it is but it's been sorta going around at my camp. i actually had to leave because everyone was talking such shit. they kept getting confused at any mention of the real world.</p><br><p>it just happens one day. it's like the backrooms is making them a part of itself? it's uncanny. nothing else about them will have changed, but where we came from being stripped off like old paint is super uncanny.</p><br><p><span class=\"forumbox\"><strong>User:</strong> <em>writing_the_past</em></span></p><br><p>That sounds like a tough camp to be in. You need any help?</p><br><p><span class=\"forumbox\"><strong>User:</strong> <em>holegecko</em></span></p><br><p>I'm alright. I've settled on 184 for the time being.

I don't know if it's pathological, completely spontaneous, or what; all I know is I couldn't have seen it coming.</p><br><p>My daughter was born here. It was on Level 11, pretty standard. But I never kept the Frontrooms a secret from her! I wanted to give her the human right to participate in her parents' culture. As much as I could.</p><br><p>We celebrated St. Paddy's every year, and had a pretend march out in the street. It was such a little moment of joy for me and for her, we felt like we were back home. Well, at least I did. But she had fun.</p><br><p>But\u2026 then\u2026 one day, she just\u2026 changed. It was like a switch flipped. Everything I had taught her about the Frontrooms. Gone. In a second.</p><br><p>Can we do something about this?</p><br><p><span class=\"forumbox\"><strong>User:</strong> <em>writing_the_past</em></span></p><br><p>I'm so sorry to hear that. I wish you the best.</p><br><p><span class=\"forumbox\"><strong>User:</strong> <em>nothinginparticular</em></span></p><br><p>Ah, I'm not sure there's anything we could do. Take her to the M.E.G. if you haven't? Maybe they have doctors who could help her? Not sure.</p><br><p><span class=\"forumbox\"><strong>User:</strong> <em>tiger.crossing</em></span></p><br><p>NO!

The glorious fulfillment of gore splaying as fist hammer fist and flesh hit flesh. Godhand is the mighty gift that grants us the primal violence our consciousness craves and the freedom to inflict this bloodlust unto whoever we brutalize. We have chosen the way others resist so vehemently, so utterly unspeakable to them that they refuse to believe in this simple truth. Rage is divine fuel, violence a simple act. Strength is supreme for all beings, a lifeblood that is to be fed on until we are all fat and full.</p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p><br><p>Godhand wills my battles; I inflict Godhand upon my enemies. I am a berserker of Godhand, elated to lay wrath and misery.</p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p><br><p>We, humans, are the developing spawns of Godhand. Once we indulge in the will of Godhand, we are filled with a sense of understanding that, alas, we have found true meaning in our freeing actions. Simply hitting flesh with our hands sends us into euphoric fulfillment, a revelation that this is how life should have been lived from the beginning. True, primal wrath to thrash and gnaw through bone and sinew and skin. Godhand is the ultimatum of existence, an objective for all of us, a simple truth to a blood-bathed world. Godhand is the manifestation of physical violence. Godhand is the split-second bloodthirst that roots from anger \u2014 anger from anyone \u2014 made incarnate. The realness that ensues once our fist hits another and a fist hits us is Godhand itself.</p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p><br><p>In the will of Godhand, our physique reaches its true peak. Strength is truth, rage is fuel, Godhand the guidance we seek.</p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p><br><p>Our bodies are the way of Godhand, the bridge to the final ascension of power, and we must strive for that ultimate power, the perfect strength. In the will of Godhand, we achieve the pinnacle form of our physique, no matter in what shape or form. What remains of us is a perfect body for battle and brutality, honed until it becomes a vessel of Godhand, the ultimate state of violent perfection. Only a handful have reached this state of absolute strength, the physical peak of Godhand. Once Godhand is within us, we are truly almighty in all ways possible. No man, no god, and no beast would any longer dare overstep the omnipotent might and will of Godhand. We are the truth that hammers down the bodies that reject Godhand, the lives that do not understand this simple truth, and the flesh that reviles our rage as some form of wicked, animalistic pleasure. All humans who have not partaken in the will of Godhand shall soon see the likeness of Godhand on their red horizons and blood seas.</p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p><br><p>To instill Godhand within us, we must first take our hands and form them into fists, then we must seek living flesh, fellow humans or \"entities\", to wound or slay. With our hands, we must brutalize the living flesh we sought, we must punch, tear, or even gnaw into the flesh with no hesitation and Godhand will slowly come to us. Relish in the blood that we splay and the gore that we gourmandize, for it is in this contentment that Godhand shall reach out to us the will and freedom we have been finding all our lives. Indulge in this freedom that Godhand has granted us; be good and the strength we need shall come naturally. Those who reach the pinnacle of this satisfaction attain the title of \"Vessel\", and are granted all strength and knowledge that signifies the worthiness of their faith in Godhand. After all, Godhand is the absolute truth, Godhand is morality and rationality, and Godhand is the simple nature of all beings. That is why we must accept Godhand's will and freedom, to prove ourselves worthy of strength and knowledge unattainable elsewhere.</p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p><br><p>Blasphemy. That is all it is, a blasphemous act. Not only do we betray ourselves when we abandon this sacred promise, but also the will of Godhand. We are disrespecting what has been set upon us from the beginning of our lives to what we are now. To ignore the offer of Godhand's grace is heresy unforgivable, a cardinal sin, something worthy of damnation and death. It is the false truth, it is the complacency we live in to form the illusion of peace when our true nature is simply brutality and the capability to harm. We must cut out that false truth from ourselves and realize our true potential in the faith of Godhand. No longer shall we be held back by the chains of our minds and no longer shall we be imprisoned in false harmony, now is the time to understand the extent of our freedom by the will of Godhand.</p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p><br><p><span class=\"meg\"><span style=\"font-size:200%;\"><strong>M.E.G.

    "description": "<p><strong>Phenomenon 99</strong>, otherwise documented as \"Forced Immortality\", is a recently discovered phenomenon that occurs haphazardly during attempted suicides. At random, any given person who attempts suicide in the Backrooms has the chance to be granted immortality; despite how this phenomenon presents itself, it is not in almost any way beneficial to those inflicted by it. For those experiencing this phenomenon, it is a highly sensitive matter, and is not to be taken lightly within the confines of the General Public Database \u2014 any individual(s) caught doing so will be punished accordingly.</p><br><p>Conclusive research on the frequency of <strong>Forced Immortality</strong> has yet to be concluded; however, there have been approximately 50 reports of it thus far, all of which have been validated by trusted <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-meg\">M.E.G.</a> operatives.</p><br><p>Anyone who attempts suicide within the Backrooms has the chance to be affected by this phenomenon, regardless of the method.</p><br><p>This phenomenon was discovered recently via reports received through the G.P.D. (General Public Database) as of 19/04/2029. Specifics of these reports will be kept classified for the sake of those affected by the phenomenon; no further detail will be provided.</p><br><p>Although <strong>Phenomenon 99</strong> has only recently been discovered, a few individuals affected by it have had the opportunity to study the specifics of it by the means of self-experimentation; despite reports only having been <em>received</em> as of recent, this phenomenon dates as far back as, allegedly, the 19th century.</p><br><p>How <strong>Forced Immortality</strong> initially manifests is an inexplicable process that has been labelled as \"the Unwanted Rebirth\". The Unwanted Rebirth consists of two different stages of which the phenomenon comprises in its whole \u2014 the phenomenon itself is very simple, though its functions are what make it especially noteworthy.</p><br><p>Firstly, immediately proceeding one's suicide is the first stage of Unwanted Rebirth: \"A glimpse into heaven\". This causes one to grasp the sensation that they are floating in the sky \u2014 in other words, an out-of-body experience. The effect that this brief moment of freedom has on one's mind has been described as that of utter shock and anticipation; anticipation to see those that one holds dearly: deceased lovers, family, and friends alike. The yearning for these precious companions is always immediately followed by the subsequent beginning of the next stage after about 30 seconds to 2 minutes of the first.</p><br><p>After one has been returned to reality, or \u2014 in other words \u2014 \"forced to fall from the heavens\", their body will be painstakingly regenerated in an instant. One's limbs will snap back into place as flesh wounds or other such damage is regenerated conventionally, albeit at a severely accelerated pace. The individual affected will feel the entirety of their injuries in a singular instant, the pain being consistently described as worse than any other form possible by any conventional means.</p><br><p>Even worse, however, is the mental and emotional trauma that this brings to anyone affected; most who are affected by this phenomenon wished for one reason or another not to be alive, and the direct denial of this can leave permanent trauma as a consequence. Psychological analysis have determined that 37 out of 42 of the individuals willing to be tested had been inflicted with some form of depression, PTSD, DID/OSDD, and/or several other mental disorders following their attempted suicide. It has been determined that this is likely due to the resolve and already deteriorated mental state that killing oneself requires being washed away, placing severe stress and a slough of negative emotions on one's brain.</p><br><p>Despite the severe negative impacts of this phenomenon, those affected by it are trying their best to move on and make the best of their eternal life. We wish them the best and support them fully.</p><br><p><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/></p><br><p>Dear Andrew,<br/>\nWe have made a massive fuck up. We should not have made this phenomenon available to the public. They aren't listening to our warnings, and there's a ton of shit going down. I need you to gather as many agents as you can to prevent a massive tragedy \u2014 I'm talking about death tolls in the thousands. Don't bother responding, just meet me at base beta with as many people as you can.<br/>\n~ Jared</p><br><p><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/></p><br><p><a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/phenomenon-99/offset/1\">When faced with eternal life, humanity cannot afford to hold back their greed...</a></p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p><br><p>\u00ab <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/phenomenon-98\">Phenomenon 98</a> | Phenomenon 99 | <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/phenomenon-100\">Phenomenon 100</a> \u00bb</p><br><p>It was greenlit by <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/bluesignet\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7867242); return false;\"><img alt=\"BlueSignet\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7867242&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334086\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7867242)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/bluesignet\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7867242); return false;\">BlueSignet</a></span>.</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/phenomenon-99\">Phenomenon 99</a>\" by r a t i f, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.
