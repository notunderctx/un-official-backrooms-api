    "description": "<p><br/>\n<em>Homo Sapiens</em> \u2014 also known as <em>Humans</em> \u2014 are a species of intelligent, nearly hairless, bipedal apes that are among the most widespread and influential sapient lifeforms. They are distinguished by their high problem-solving capabilities, rapid learning rate, and highly social lifestyle. Humans display a natural drive for learning, which has encouraged development of technologies, sciences, religions and cultures within human social structures. Due to originating in a <a href=\"/the-frontrooms\">separate universe</a>, they were mostly uncontested by any harsh threats, and built a unique and thriving populace in the reality they called home.</p><br><p>An ancient skull found in the Backrooms from a long-dead human ancestor, possibly a sister species.</p><br><p>Ever since Humans (and even their early ancestors) first began existing in the Frontrooms, a great number of them have <a href=\"/phenomenon-5\">crossed realities</a> by complete accident. This resulted in human beings settling within the Backrooms and building civilizations to survive the harsh environment and native fauna. One of the most densely human-populated levels in current times is <a href=\"/level-11\">level 11</a>, which closely resembles an environment associated with the humans\u2019 original reality.</p><br><p>Ancient humans settled in a number of locations, many choosing to stay in the ones they noclipped into, or anywhere directly connected to them.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> Using their capabilities listed, they were able to surpass great adversities and settle in otherwise dangerous places. Some settlements date back <a href=\"/level-51\">a millennia ago</a> whilst others are <a href=\"/level-179\">far more recent</a>, and stick out even among urban realities as a sign of their ability to survive.</p><br><p>An abandoned hut in <a href=\"/level-46\">Level 46</a>, originating from an abandoned a deserted settlement.</p><br><p>Despite the harsh environment they now lived in, humans have unknowingly afflicted a variety of damages to its landscape. The requirement for food and large settlements has resulted in the damage of much flora and fauna, and their aggression to most entities native to the Backrooms has dwindled their populations. Upkeep of their settlements requires constant gathering of precious, sometimes rare materials, which have only become rarer from human interference. Because of this induced scarcity, humans spread further, taking more materials, and repeating the process almost infinitely. In a way, this would mean that human beings are comparable to invading pests, and yet they cannot receive blame, as they merely wish to continue thriving and surviving in a harsh environment, while the local wildlife and environment tries to do the same.</p><br><p>Although indirectly, the large-scale presence of humans has led to the creation of multiple entities that resemble them in appearance, mannerisms and biology. Some are near perfect replicas, such as <a href=\"/entity-9\">Facelings</a>, whilst others \u2014 like <a href=\"/entity-8\">Hounds</a> \u2014 are more liberal interpretations of the human body. Human-like entities have existed seemingly as long as humans themselves, with some even evolving to be as similar as possible throughout centuries. Whilst mainly a fault of humans in their original universe, their impact has caused the Backrooms to mimic several things built by them in its evolution of levels. This effect has had an influence which has <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-hub/offset/2\">existed for thousands of years</a> and, seemingly, <a href=\"/level-15\">will continue indefinitely</a> \u2014 drastically reshaping the course of the future.</p><br><p>An early incarnation of the public database, and potentially the formings of <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-21\">the Backrooms' early internet</a>.</p><br><p>One positive shaping of history is the humans\u2019 ability to communicate information to each other in order to survive, something which led to the creation of this very database. It is a tool that contains documentation of anomalous <a href=\"/entities\">species</a>, <a href=\"/objects\">objects</a>, <a href=\"/phenomena\">events</a>, <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/normal-levels-i\">locations</a>, <a href=\"/poi-s\">people</a>, and a plethora of unique <a href=\"/tales\">stories</a> and experiences. It is one of the biggest archives of documentation left by human beings, bested only by the advent of the internet in their home world. It is a permanent mark of their existence that has been, and will be, utilized for as long as humans thrive themselves.</p><br><p>Three separate civilizations in the Frontrooms that built structures in a similar shape, displaying their semi-unified thinking.</p><br><p>Humans all share unique behaviors and personalities, but have many common thought processes that link them. A great majority of humans have highly sociable mannerisms, <a href=\"/level-206\">a desire to seek out the unknown</a>, and the need to populate <a href=\"/level-184\">uninhabited</a>, potentially <a href=\"/level-207\">dangerous</a> locations. This method of thinking, whilst no doubt effective in maintaining the population and guaranteeing its expansion, has caused quite irreversibly altered the Backrooms in the ways already listed.</p><br><p>Their need to seek knowledge and live in hazardous areas also causes <a href=\"/level-174\">significant casualties</a>, but has guaranteed the future survival of the species thanks to rigorous documentation, which is used \u2014 often thanklessly \u2014 by the people who come after. From this research, they have built all sorts of towns, cities, bases, communities, and outposts, all of which are operated by groups of various intentions. Though information about human occupation before the modern database is scarce, the information that is known shows they operated much like modern ones we have today.</p><br><p>Despite their ability to cooperate, they can be deeply aggressive towards one another in certain situations of rivalry or disagreement. It often leads to conflicts and casualties that set back progress or alliances. Which makes human beings extremely unpredictable to the eyes of others.<br/>\n<br/></p><br><p>An example of the cooperation of Frontrooms humans to create the largest known civilizations in existence.</p><br><p>Throughout the centuries, humans have repeatedly made specific choices in where to build their settlements. Usually, they greatly prefer places that resemble areas in the Frontrooms, whether it be a locations geography, its <a href=\"/level-45\">similarities to real places</a>, or places where they can easily <a href=\"/level-281\">gather or grow resources</a>. Whilst they mostly favor settling in places with <a href=\"/level-11\">little to no dangerous entities</a>, or <a href=\"/level-159\">places with solely civilized entities</a>, many humans sometimes occupy the same spaces as hostile threats. Whilst <a href=\"/level-200\">sometimes inadvertently</a>, some also <a href=\"/level-186\">do it by conscious choice</a>, usually for a chance at protection or as a last ditch effort to survive. This, however, usually backfires.</p><br><p>By far the most important factor of choice, however, is the structure of time inside of a location. Humans prefer those that follow the typical circadian rhythm, usually in the form of a day and night cycle or a close emulation. However, when a level lacks said passage of time, they tend to opt for levels that always have daylight,<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup> both for easy visibility and protection of their mental health. If a place has no daylight but still has a plethora of materials, humans may opt to use their own created light sources, <a href=\"/level-52\">which is something they have been doing for generations</a>.</p><br><p>Some of the most populated locations are <a href=\"/level-4\">Level 4</a>, <a href=\"/level-11\">Level 11</a>, <a href=\"/level-29\">Level 29</a>, <a href=\"/level-186\">Level 186</a>, and <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/level-737\">Level 737</a>, which have populations deep into the thousands. By many, these locations are regarded as main hubs and the main places to live in the Backrooms. As with all human achievements, each of these locations have been terraformed and adapted in different ways to achieve their large population, disrupting flora and fauna to do so.</p><br><p>The same can also be said for fallen civilizations, such as <a href=\"/level-22\">Level 22</a>\u2019s Emstable and <a href=\"/level-51\">Level 51</a>\u2019s Hoofstad, who both did much the same. The only difference being that these groups both over-expanded, and reached the end of their \u201ccycles\u201d.</p><br><p>The ruins of an old Backrooms civilization, potentially predating <a href=\"/the-lost\">the Lost</a>.</p><br><p>Whilst not a phenomena exclusive to human Backrooms communities, there has been a pattern followed by most major communities and groups that have been built by humans throughout all of history. Each group, in varying spaces of time, follows a similar cycle of events from their inception which inevitably leads to their downfall.</p><br><p>Groups, especially <a href=\"/the-lost\">many older ones</a>, form under a specific, small leadership with a fairly rigid set of goals and morals. Gradually, however, these groups expand. They gather more people, expand their physical and technological reaches further, until the group becomes a haphazard imitation of what it once was. Usually, as has been recorded in both <a href=\"/the-iron-fist\">ancient times</a> and the <a href=\"/b-n-t-g\">modern day</a>, this results in a schism of the group that causes it to split and become not what it once was, or in rare cases even causing them to cease existing entirely.</p><br><p>Most, if not all groups fall into this cycle, and a group that reaches the end of its lifespan will inevitably be replaced by one that has just begun. As is often the case, people from previous groups migrate to new ones, sharing the previous downfalls as to extend the lifespan of the new, younger group.<br/>\n<br/></p><br><p><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/></p><br><p>[[/=]]</p><br><p><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/></p><br><p><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/></p><br><p><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/></p><br><p><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/></p><br><p><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/></p><br><p><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/></p><br><p><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/></p><br><p><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/></p><br><p><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/></p><br><p><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/></p><br><p><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/></p><br><p><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/></p><br><p>However, for as effective at survival as humans are, they possess one, fatal flaw. Despite their keen passion\u2014and adept ability\u2014to mould and shape the Backrooms, none of what they ever do is permanent. Every civilisation, no matter how <a href=\"/the-m-e-g\">grand</a> or <a href=\"/the-lost\">long lasting</a> it is, inevitably crumbles and falls. Often, other humans simply take the place of their extinct predecessor, but in all cases the Backrooms eventually comes out victorious. Its native entities and laws of physics outlive and outperform all humans actions, no matter how great any one civilisation is at the height of its power.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHumans are just a speck, one entity out of over one thousand, and their grand achievements do nothing to change that. The combined forces of its <a href=\"/entities\">other creatures</a>, <a href=\"/phenomena\">natural effects</a>, and <a href=\"/normal-levels-i\">rapidly evolving landscapes</a> not only outdo, but eventually eliminate humanity and its footprint as a whole.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHypothetically speaking, the latter two effects could wipe out all its creatures, and its natural effects could cause all levels to eventually pass away the same as humans. However, whilst this itself is uncertain, it is known that humans \u2014 rather morbidly \u2014 will be the first to go.<br/>\n<br/></p><br><p>Humans are just a chapter in the history of the Backrooms.</p><br><p><br/></p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span> | Entity 1 | <a href=\"/entity-2\">Entity 2</a> \u00bb</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/entity-1\">Entity 1</a>\" by Nikuchan, BoringTalking, PaintPalette, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

The <strong>Duller</strong> will then no-clip its arm through the wall capturing the prey on the other side, and then drag them into their hall. If you notice a <strong>Duller</strong>, without their hunting tactic, they will silently run away. It is unknown what they do to you once captured. They can sometimes take seemingly random objects, and it is unknown what they do with the items.

Its habitat is mainly <a href=\"/level-1\">Level 1</a>, but it occasionally spotted in <a href=\"/level-2\">Level 2</a>. This level is home to Jerry's \"home\", known as <a href=\"/level-274\">level 274</a>, where Jerry and his followers are often found. Those who make physical contact with Jerry without taming him are subject to his indoctrination abilities. Jerry can be tamed using sunflower seeds or <a href=\"/object-1\">Almond Water</a>. Otherwise, it is safest to avoid Jerry at all costs.</p><br><p>Survivors that make physical contact with Jerry (without attempting to tame him) will be affected by his \"indoctrination abilities\". This basically makes the victim worship Jerry like a god, chanting phrases such as <em>\"Jerry is everything\"</em>, <em>\"Jerry is what I live for\"</em>, and <em>\"All Hail Jerry\"</em>. After a few hours, the assimilated will disappear to <a href=\"/level-274\">Level 274</a>, where they will remain until they choose to exit and \"spread the word of Jerry\". Jerry's followers will act like mindless zombies until they reach Jerry's Room, at which point they will regain control of themselves, and will now worship Jerry as if his god-like status was ingrained into their mind.</p><br><p>Unless you are attempting to tame Jerry, he will make chase when he sees you. According to Reddit user u/ReinoThePenguin, those who manage to outrun Jerry and avoid being assimilated will be instantly no-clipped into the ground. Whether or not Jerry has the ability to cause others to noclip is still being investigated. Jerry will typically either wander <a href=\"/level-1\">Level 1</a> and <a href=\"/level-2\">2</a>, or sit on a wooden perch in <a href=\"/level-274\">Level 274</a>. Here, followers will kneel before him and chant to him.</p><br><p>Jerry has a physical appearance of an adolescent male macaw parrot, with blue and white feathers. Jerry's diet consists mainly of sunflower seeds and <a href=\"/object-1\">Almond Water</a>. By slowly approaching Jerry with almond water or sunflower seeds, Jerry can be tamed. Taming Jerry will allow you to hold him and not be affected by his indoctrination abilities. After a few days of being tamed, Jerry will fly away and will not assimilate the tamer if contact is made again. Jerry has been reported to have noclipping abilities, and other powers that he has are currently unknown.</p><br><p>A diary entry referencing Jerry was discovered in June of 2019, the entry in question being written in 1959.

They are highly aggressive, and are made aggressive when they see someone in an aggressive state, but can be intimidated by direct eye contact.</p><br><p>Hounds become hostile the moment they see a human. However, they become intimidated when you give direct eye contact and stare them down. This won't work for long however, but it should be enough time to get your bearings and make a run for it.

They have sharp claws, and an extremely large mouth with sharp teeth. However, this is often unseen due to the amount of hair.

The anatomical structure of facelings strongly resembles that of a human\u2019s \u2013 though they do not appear to actually need internal organs to live or function. Facelings also mimic human practices, roles, and routines, often in a manner which exhibits limited understanding of their purposes in human life.</p><br><p>Additionally, the creatures seem to mirror human population patterns. Facelings predominantly inhabit levels with urban environments and/or significant human populations \u2013 including <a href=\"/level-11\">Level 11</a>. Any level with even a trace of human architecture is likely to carry with it a faceling population. Moreover, the number of facelings is thought to be correlated to human population size.

The most widely accepted of these posits that facelings are the Backrooms\u2019 attempts at replicating humankind, ever since our race first manifested within its confines. The process is believed to be analogous to that of \u201clevel generation\u201d. Just as many \u201cFrontrooms replica\u201d levels appear to be constructed with a resemblance to real Frontrooms locations, these entities are created in like fashion, as a facsimile of the human inhabitants of these places \u2013 though imperfectly warped and twisted, as these levels often are.</p><br><p>Furthermore, though these attempts at replicating humans were initially deformed and \u201cnot quite right\u201d, it is thought that a process of \u201cnatural selection\u201d eventually began to occur. As imperfect specimens perished quickly, more well-developed specimens started taking over, driving the course of evolution through trial and error.</p><br><p>This process has, moreover, resulted in diversification of the species, akin to genetic branching. There exists a plethora of distinct types of facelings today, with characteristics which vary widely between the types.<br/>\n<br/></p><br><p>There are some facelings that do not possess regular human-like appearances, being wildly different from their common counterparts. One such bizarre variation is known as the <strong>Polygonal Faceling</strong>.</p><br><p>As their name suggests, the bodies of these variants are composed of large, flat, polygonal surfaces. Though they remain roughly humanoid in shape, they appear much more awkward and boxy, bearing similarity to early 3-dimensional video game characters. Their skin is rough, dry, and flaky to the touch.</p><br><p>Evidence suggests that polygonal facelings receive their strange appearance through inadvertent <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/phenomenon-5\">no-clipping</a>. The exact mechanics behind such an adverse reaction is unknown, but it is assumed that their already unstable body structures are unable to withstand the pressure of cross-dimensional travel.<br/>\n<br/></p><br><p>A sketch of a Polygonal Faceling.</p><br><p><br/></p><br><p>A variant known as <strong>Shadow Facelings</strong> has pitch-black, spectral bodies. They tend to be found spontaneously levitating within darker regions of the Backrooms. They also seem to be drawn toward sources of light. Compared to common facelings, these specimens are much more easily agitated. These facelings are prone to fright and defensive aggression in the presence of people, although they do not appear to possess the strength to cause significant harm. Furthermore, they are easily distracted with flashlights or torches, making them easy to evade. Many wanderers who have encountered these facelings have noted similarities in their behaviors to those of <a href=\"/entity-3\">Smilers</a>. Even so, no relation between the two entities has yet been discovered.<br/>\n<br/></p><br><p>A sketch of a Shadow Faceling.</p><br><p><br/></p><br><p><strong>Memory Facelings</strong> are an exceptionally unique faceling variant. They are exceedingly rare, with under 20 documented and verified reports presently in existence, making research into their odd properties challenging.</p><br><p>Facelings of this type are known to assume the appearance of loved ones of wanderers who are in close proximity \u2013 though, naturally, they continue to lack facial features in this state. It is theorized that they access and respond to the memories of a wanderer in order to shift between different forms. Other than the physical change, these variations also seem to attempt to replicate the mannerisms and routines of the person they are attempting to mimic. The sight of long-lost loved ones can provoke rather emotional responses from wanderers who encounter this variant. Though some connection with <a href=\"/entity-42\">the Memory Worm</a> is suspected, there is presently no explanation for how memory facelings possess these abilities.</p><br><p>A zoomed in picture of a female adult faceling.</p><br><p><br/>\n<br/>\nAs their outward appearance suggests, facelings anatomically resemble human beings, though malformed on the inside. Aside from their visible lack of facial features, most of their organs are severely underdeveloped, and are usually only partially functional.</p><br><p>Description of the creatures\u2019 physiological processes is a complex task, as the exact bodily demands of facelings differ from specimen to specimen. However, in general, facelings do not even seem to need the organs they commonly lack, in order to survive and operate. For example, though they have missing mouths and incomplete digestive tracts, they do not require food, and though they do not possess eyes, they move around as if they were able to see. Instead, the half-formed organs of facelings appear to cause more harm than help. Though a faceling\u2019s organs often do not contribute actively to their survival, they are prone to failure in their partially developed state, causing complications which can hurt or even kill the faceling. As a result of their dysfunction, organs have been known to rot, rupture, or grow tumors which overtake working bodily systems. A majority of facelings die naturally as a result of such organ failures.</p><br><p>The life-cycle of facelings is another subject of biological interest. Facelings have not been observed to procreate, but instead apparently come into being randomly, or \u201cspontaneously generate\u201d, in levels they inhabit. The physical appearance of any given faceling is not indicative of their actual age, as it is believed that the creatures may be generated to outwardly resemble any human age group. Following generation, facelings usually proceed to age as normal human beings do.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup></p><br><p>Facelings resembling infants upon generation are often much more fully developed. This is most likely due to the relative simplicity of human infants in their anatomy, compared to human adults. However, faceling infants also tend to die rather quickly, as their internal organs fail to develop beyond infancy, and are unable to sustain their growth. Facelings generated as children or adolescents face similar issues; they are often developmentally stunted, though a substantial proportion of them are able to mature and survive into late adulthood. Generated adult facelings face fewer complications, and are frequently able to survive into old age.</p><br><p>Most significantly, some recent specimens of entity 9 appear to have begun the final stage of evolutionary development. Occasional reports of facelings possessing aberrant facial organs (such as a single eye or ear) have existed for quite some time. However, in recent years, a marked number of facelings have begun to exhibit complete, though malformed, sets of facial features. Unlike their faceless counterparts, these evolved specimens seem to both possess and rely on more complete internal systems, which work well with the previously absent facial features. For instance, along with their noses, evolved facelings have more complete respiratory systems and actively breathe air.</p><br><p>Despite this, the newly evolved facial organs continue to suffer critical defects. The nostrils are usually partially fused together, causing severe respiratory problems. Though they are able to see, and rely on sight to navigate, the eyeballs of these specimens are small and primitive, resulting in myopia<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup> Their mouths lack any lips, and often remain wide open due to underdevelopment of the jaws.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')\">3</a></sup> Their ears are also flattened, and produce excessive amounts of earwax which obstruct the inner auditory canal, such that their hearing is limited.</p><br><p><br/></p><br><p>A sketch of the facial features of an evolved faceling.</p><br><p><br/>\n<br/>\nApart from facial features, evolved facelings present physiological developments in a few other key areas as well. As with ordinary facelings, the hair on evolved facelings\u2019 heads is fully present; evolved specimens have, however, begun to develop additional body and facial hair. Even so, eyebrows and eyelashes tend to be absent, such that their eyes remain susceptible to dirt and infection. Furthermore, remains of a few deceased individuals demonstrate fully-formed skeletons, though they continue to exhibit the brittleness characteristic of the bones of regular facelings.</p><br><p><br/></p><br><p>Yet in spite of this obsession, the creatures demonstrate a fundamental lack of understanding of human society, and often engage in activities with little sense of logic, intentionality, or higher purpose. A faceling \u201cworking\u201d as a cashier may willingly receive any sum of money, without regard for the actual value of a purchase. A faceling \u201coffice worker\u201d may perpetually remain at its desk, typing randomly on the keyboard of its unpowered computer terminal, never leaving to rest. A faceling \u201cpedestrian\u201d may follow the same predetermined route through the streets, day after day, without variation, and without question.</p><br><p>The creatures have been observed to interact with one another rather amicably. In spite of their lack of sensory organs, they appear to clearly understand each other, and often attempt to replicate regular human social interactions, to varying degrees of success. Specimens have been observed waving to those whom they recognize, engaging in conversations (silent, since they lack vocal chords) and pausing in their daily routines to help others in need. Within some levels, the entities even demonstrate intelligent collective behaviors. Facelings are known to form friendships or find romantic partners, and even establish large families, with adults adopting child facelings as their own.</p><br><p>However, facelings are well-known for being easily angered by even small disturbances.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-4\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')\">4</a></sup> These emotional episodes can escalate to full on outbursts, especially when they are intentionally assaulted. Facelings in this state are known to physically attack what aggravated them, as well as generally causing destruction to the surrounding environment. However, being physically weaker than most human adults, angry facelings are relatively easy to evade.</p><br><p>Psychological research has shown that the entities seem to have poor impulse control and struggle with proper emotional regulation overall. This is almost certainly the cause of their poor assessment of and exaggerated response to perceived threats. Brain scans of facelings have determined that this is likely due to a smaller and more primitive frontal lobe.</p><br><p>Though they may lack strength, provoking a faceling is inadvisable \u2013- and particularly so if more of them are close by. The entities become exceptionally aggressive if they notice any intentional attempt to harm another one of their kind. They will do anything in their power to defend each other, and especially to protect child facelings. Facelings are also known to react more strongly if they possess close social or familial bonds to victims.</p><br><p>Notably, child facelings have been reported as the most aggressive and unstable during outbursts. Because their brain is even less developed, they lack the ability to regulate emotions at all, and are frequently unable to distinguish right from wrong. When upset, they immediately begin hitting and scratching anyone nearby, and may injure themselves in the process. Applying traditional techniques to calm human children appears effective.</p><br><p>The following are records of encounters with a regular adult faceling and child faceling respectively. Both were taken for closer analysis and study of faceling behavior.<br/>\n<br/></p><br><p><strong>Location:</strong> <a href=\"/level-116\">Level 116</a><br/>\n<strong>Agents in charge of encounter:</strong> Zaina Knight.<br/>\n<strong>Purpose of recording:</strong> Analysis of Adult faceling behaviour.</p><br><p><em>[Agent Knight is visible, entering the ice rink with a pair of ice skates on her feet.The camera trembles slightly, as Knight regains her balance. Various facelings can be seen clumsily skating around the rink.]</em></p><br><p><strong>Agent Knight:</strong> The facelings here are trying to skate\u2026 but some of them look to be struggling.</p><br><p><em>[As agent Knight begins moving, a thud can be heard behind her. The camera whirls around to show an adult faceling. It appears to have fallen to the ground after losing its balance.]</em></p><br><p><strong>Agent Knight:</strong> Ah! A faceling fell down\u2026 is it hurt?</p><br><p><em>[The agent moves towards the entity and helps it back on its feet. The faceling grasps onto her arm for support.]</em></p><br><p><strong>Agent Knight:</strong> Here you go, buddy.</p><br><p><em>[Agent Knight waits for the faceling to leave. Instead, the entity continues to hold on to her arm.]</em></p><br><p><strong>Agent Knight:</strong> Oh! You\u2026 want me to help you skate?</p><br><p><em>[The Faceling is seen tightening its grip a little on the agent's arm. Its featureless face stares expectantly toward Knight, as if in an attempt to communicate an answer.]</em></p><br><p><strong>Agent Knight:</strong> I'll assume that's a yes? I'm not that great at skating, but\u2026 I\u2019ll manage.</p><br><p><em>[The agent holds the Faceling's hand and remains close as the two begin skating. Over time, the creature seems to gain confidence. Its strides, at first tentative and nervous, become energetic and enthusiastic.]</em></p><br><p><strong>Agent Knight:</strong> Hah! Seems like you\u2019re getting it! I\u2019ll speed up now\u2026 don't fall behind!</p><br><p><em>[The two continue to twirl about the rink. Much to both their delight, Knight is eventually able to let go. Though it continues to stumble on occasion, the creature skates fairly competently on its own, as its companions continue to slip and slide around it.]</em></p><br><p><strong>Agent Knight:</strong> There you go! Good job!</p><br><p><em>[The two continue to skate together, racing one another around the complex with glee. After about ten minutes or so, Knight is satisfied, and directs the faceling to exit the ice rink. The agent helps the creature undo its laces, and the two head to place the ice skates back in the lockers. ]</em></p><br><p><strong>Agent Knight:</strong> You seemed to have fun back there! Huh, who knew that you guys could express yourselves in this way.</p><br><p><em>[The Faceling is nodding repeatedly, apparently to indicate its happiness.]</em></p><br><p><strong>Agent Knight:</strong> I suppose my idea of teaching you all sign language wouldn't be that bad after all. Maybe you could learn to communicate better! I really should suggest this to the higher ups\u2026</p><br><p><em>[The camera shows Agent Knight as she makes her way to an exit. The Faceling follows after her. As she turns to leave, it gently reaches out and tugs at her arm.]</em></p><br><p><strong>Agent Knight:</strong> Oh\u2026 do you want me to stay?</p><br><p><em>[There is a short pause.]</em></p><br><p><strong>Agent Knight:</strong> I\u2019m really sorry bud, but I can\u2019t stay.</p><br><p><em>[The faceling refuses to let go. Its head drops slightly, as if in disappointment.]</em></p><br><p><strong>Agent Knight:</strong> Awww, you guys really do get attached, huh? Alright\u2026 if I can I'll come visit you and we can go skating again. Okay?</p><br><p><em>[The faceling seems to understand. Tentatively, it lets go of the agent\u2019s arm, and steps back, somewhat reluctantly. Agent Knight waves, heading towards the exit. The faceling raises its arm, returning the gesture rather clumsily, as Agent Knight safely exits the level, and returns to Base.]</em></p><br><p><strong>Result:</strong> Upon Agent Knight\u2019s return, the footage was analyzed further. From what was observed, it appears that facelings are capable of learning and expressing themselves. Though these abilities appear limited, they are nevertheless more advanced than previously believed. Most notably, the specimen demonstrated that facelings can establish bonds with other beings besides themselves, and are able to understand and mimic human gestures.</p><br><p>Agent Knight was allowed to return and interact with the faceling in the recording on multiple further occasions. The faceling was observed to recognize her and exhibited affectionate behaviour. Presently, the Overseers are considering Knight\u2019s proposal to transport the facelings to Base Omega, to teach it how to write and converse in sign language.</p><br><p>It is noted that ex-agents have accomplished this before in past experiments. If Knight\u2019s experiment is approved and achieves success, it is likely to become a widespread initiative.</p><br><p>Future reports on the faceling's progress will be updated here.<br/>\n<br/></p><br><p><strong>Location:</strong> <a href=\"/level-6-1\">Level 6.1</a><br/>\n<strong>Agents in charge of encounter:</strong> Grover Bryne<br/>\n<strong>Purpose of recording:</strong> Analysis of Child Faceling behaviour.</p><br><p><em>[Agent Bryne showcases the environment of the level as he searches for a Child Faceling around the area.]</em></p><br><p><strong>Agent Bryne:</strong> For now there are no Child Facelings in sight. All I\u2019m seeing are the guys working in the stores.</p><br><p><em>[The agent explores for another 10 minutes until he stumbles upon a child faceling. The creature is on the ground, kicking and punching the air in distress.]</em></p><br><p><strong>Agent Bryne:</strong> Seems like this one is upset. But about what?</p><br><p><em>[There is a short pause.]</em></p><br><p><strong>Agent Bryne:</strong> Hm, I'll see if I can calm it down, or at least try to examine the situation.</p><br><p><em>[Agent Bryne approaches the entity and gently lifts it up in his arms, as he attempts to communicate. He is seen stroking the entity's head softly.]</em></p><br><p><strong>Agent Bryne:</strong> Hey kiddo, what's wrong?</p><br><p><em>[At first, the entity struggles and beats against Agent Bryne\u2019s shoulder with its tiny fists. As Bryne continues to reassure the child, it gradually begins to calm down. Eventually, it resorts to tugging at his sleeve, while gesturing toward a vending machine full of snacks.]</em></p><br><p><strong>Agent Bryne:</strong> Oh\u2026 do you want some of those snacks? I\u2019m guessing you don\u2019t know how to use the vending machine?</p><br><p><em>[There is a short pause.]</em></p><br><p><strong>Agent Bryne:</strong> I'll get some sweets for you, kiddo\u2026 though how will you even eat them?</p><br><p><em>[The agent calmly presses a few buttons on the vending machine. The child faceling claps its hands in delight as a few different snacks are dispensed. Bryne stoops down and retrieves them, placing them into the arms of the child. It seems satisfied..]</em></p><br><p><strong>Agent Bryne:</strong> Guess you just wanted to hold them. Oh well, at the very least you seem calm, now. You really do act just like a normal kid\u2026 though you could really learn to control your temper.</p><br><p><em>[There is a short pause]</em></p><br><p><strong>Agent Bryne:</strong> I should probably report this back to Base\u2026 Hm?</p><br><p><em>[Agent Bryne points the camera down to show the child faceling hugging onto his leg. Agent Bryne attempts to gently remove its arms, but it refuses to let go.]</em></p><br><p><strong>Agent Bryne:</strong> Seems like you won't let me go without you! Welp, guess I\u2019m a dad now. I'll have some explaining to do\u2026</p><br><p><em>[Agent Bryne carries the Child Faceling to the nearest exit, returning to Base.]</em></p><br><p><strong>Result:</strong> Agent Bryne returned with the child faceling, naming her Alice. With approval from M.E.G. command, he has been raising it as his own. Recently, he has begun teaching her how to write, though she has yet to make noticeable progress.</p><br><p>Even so, through his supervision, Alice seems to have become calmer and more well-adjusted, and much less prone to tantrums. Future progress will be recorded here in due time.<br/>\n<br/></p><br><p>A picture of Alice.</p><br><p><br/></p><br><p>Following these encounters, it soon became clear that facelings are capable of intelligent communication and social cooperation with humanity. An initiative to teach intelligent language to facelings has been approved, and is currently spearheaded by the recently promoted Entity Research Specialist Zaina Knight. Under the programme, operatives have discovered that evolved specimens were able to learn sign language and writing much more quickly. Many are already able to communicate in this manner proficiently on their own. The initiative next hopes is to teach vocalization by using the alphabet, in the hopes of teaching these specimens to communicate with verbal human speech.</p><br><p>It is believed that over the course of many years, with further evolution aided by such human intervention, the majority of evolved facelings will be able to speak in simple, coherent sentences, while their faceless counterparts will be able to fully comprehend sign language and writing.<br/>\n<br/></p><br><p><br/></p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/entity-8\">Entity 8</a> | Entity 9 | <a href=\"/entity-10\">Entity 10</a> \u00bb</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/entity-9\">Entity 9 - \"Facelings\"</a>\" by Original co authors~ Jo and Higher Being Love Cereal!.

    "description": "<p>Entity 10, more commonly known as the Skin-Stealers, are large humanoid entities that can wear the skin of their victims as a disguise. They eat human flesh when in a hunger state, and otherwise roam aimlessly if they do not need to eat. Their blood is translucent, and they can mimic human speech. They are most commonly found on the first 3 levels, but have been seen in many other levels.</p><br><p>Skin-Stealers are typically docile creatures and will wander aimlessly if they do not need to feed. In this stage, they will not be hostile unless you aggravate them. In a hunger state, they will seek out humans wandering alone and will then use their strength to tear them apart with their hands.</p><br><p>Skin-Stealers are tall, pale yellow humanoids with sunken white eyes. Their outer layer of flesh is covered with microscopic bumps similar to the suckers of an octopus' tentacle. These stick to skin that is torn off of humans, and push and pull on it to make it fit, until the Skin-Stealer looks identical to a human. These bumps also pump blood and nutrients into the skin, to make it feel warm and alive as well as prevent decomposition. In addition, it heals the skin, hiding any cuts that may identify a real human. After a period of around 24 hours, the skin will be digested through the surface of the Skin-Stealer, and the Skin-Stealer will enter a docile state.</p><br><p>A Skin-Stealer also has the ability to speak, but it cannot understand language. It will repeat what it hears (often in varying languages) in order to lure in prey, but it cannot actually communicate.

    "description": "<p>These creatures are found on <a href=\"/level-3\">Level 3</a> and appear vaguely humanoid in appearance. They crawl on all fours to move across the halls of the backrooms, with their back legs further stretched out (more similar to a canine's leg structure then to ours). On the back of the burster are many calluses, that explode in small pops of acidic fluids when agitated or hunting prey.</p><br><p>The bursters will stay mostly docile in a fetal-like position, but when a living creature comes near the calluses on its back will burst, causing an explosion of acidic like substances to spray against the victim's face, usually impairing their vision. After this occurs the burster will wait for the acid to kill the victim, which it usually succeeds in doing. If the victim survives the burster will continue to spray acid until said victim has succumbed to shock, wherein the burster will consume the victim.</p><br><p>The bursters appear to also be somewhat damaged by the acid they produce. When a burster is hurt by either an excess amount of acid within a burst, or by other means, they will begin to \"harden\" their skin in a cocoon like material. These cocoons can be broken, with enough force, causing the burster to die.</p><br><p>The bursters are also extremely vulnerable to almond water. This causes severe burns to the burster, which they usually do not recover from. It is assumed that the acid the burster produces causes some sort of negative reaction when in contact with any type of water.</p><br><p>When bursters were first discovered, they were presumed to be a sub-species of the hound. However the classification was changed after successfully killing a burster without causing it to cocoon itself, during which enough biological differences were found to determine it a different species than the hound.</p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/entity-10\">Entity 10</a> | Entity 11 | <a href=\"/entity-12\">Entity 12</a> \u00bb</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/entity-11\">Entity 11 - \"Bursters\"</a>\" by Kekcroc, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

    "title": "- \"Dunks\"",
    "description": "<p>Dunks are small, boxy entities, sporting a long trunk that strikingly resembles a human arm. Dunks are well-known for how easily they may be tamed, and how excessively compliant they are towards their owners. Dunks are naturally peaceful in temperament. However, due to their unquestioning obedience towards their owners, tamed dunks will not hesitate to commit acts of extreme violence if commanded. Interestingly, the only exception is the fact that dunks will always refuse to attack anyone with an elderly appearance or age. Dunks also seem to be rather adventurous and are found in a majority of well-lit levels. As a result, they boast remarkable adaptive capabilities.</p><br><p>Wild Dunks are quite adventurous. They are known to wander large distances, rarely settling in any one area. Though they tend to stay within the bounds of a single level, it is not unheard of for them to wander across multiple levels, leaving clones behind them as they go. Wild dunks are passive in disposition, and will neither attack nor help others. They seem indifferent towards other entities and pay no mind to anything which does not directly bother or endanger them.</p><br><p>Dunks were previously believed to be completely emotionless, but closer examination has revealed that they do experience basic emotions, like most animal lifeforms. However, dunks rarely express what they are feeling. Displays of emotion have only been observed in wild dunks while they interact with other dunks, or in solitude. Tamed dunks never display emotion of any kind, apart from a sense of loyalty to their owner.</p><br><p>Research has shown that wild dunks seem to try to avoid being tamed, avoiding human contact, and trying to run away from anyone who approaches them. It is speculated that dunks would rather live free and undisturbed, and, when tamed, may be forced to obey every order against their will.</p><br><p>Of course, dunks only behave in this manner until they are tamed. Dunks can be tamed by wanderers as well as entities. Simply by tapping the end of their hand-shaped trunk, they may be brought to a state of trust and total acquiescence. Almost immediately, they will begin to physically follow their new owner and will answer to commands no matter the language or if words are even spoken. They seem to have an amazing ability to understand orders, without needing their owner to even speak. Because of this, it is speculated that they have telepathic powers. Despite their subservience, however, dunks do have basic common sense, and will usually ignore any commands that they are physically incapable of completing, or which are generally absurd.</p><br><p>Owners who have accidentally tamed dunks will have no way to disown them other than by terminating the entity or by dying themselves. If a dunk\u2019s owner enters somewhere that their dunk cannot, their dunk will repeatedly hit their head against the object obstructing its path. Sadly, this usually leads to the death of the dunk. Owners who wish to temporarily leave their dunk may overcome this difficulty by placing them in a padded enclosure or commanding their dunk to stay in an area.</p><br><p>Dunks will defend their owners at all costs, even to the point of giving up their lives, unless told otherwise. They can be used to attack others, and seem to show no hesitation, fear, or reluctance, even when told to commit acts of extreme violence. Smarter entities have even been observed taming dunks and using them to attack wanderers, though this is a rare sight. When sent to attack an organism, dunks will normally use their trunk to grab their victims, pulling themselves towards their target. They will then slam themselves against their target, painfully goring them with their sharp horns. While this may seem intimidating, dunks are physically rather weak compared to other entities. They are easy to evade as they are not particularly strong or fast, and can be outpaced with little difficulty. However, their body can be quite heavy, so you are advised not to let dunks put their weight onto you. If you fall over and a dunk sits on top of you, it may crush you or leaves you immobilized and vulnerable on the ground.</p><br><p>The only order dunks have been known to reject is the order to harm anyone with an elderly appearance. Some examples of this are Old Man Facelings or wanderers who look 50 years old or above. It is believed that this behavioral quirk has to do with the way dunks were first domesticated.</p><br><p>When in a new environment, wild dunks will start a process where they intentionally clone themselves, with their clone taking on aspects suited to their surrounding area. This acts as a sort of sped-up evolutionary process, where dunks can adapt to fit into their environment. More information on this process may be found under 'Biology'. After cloning itself, the original dunk will carry on like usual, they will invariably abandon the clone, wandering on to find a more suitable level for themselves. The clone usually stays within the level they are built for.</p><br><p>Artist's rendition of a Basic Dunk.</p><br><p>Artist's rendition of a Dunk's Muscular system.</p><br><p>Artist's rendition of a Dunk's Skeletal system.</p><br><p>Dunks are small entities with the appearance of miniature, boxy elephants, having an average height on average of 2.5 ft (76\u00a0cm), a width of 2.4 ft (73\u00a0cm), and a length of 3.5ft (106cm). They are exceptionally heavy with a weight of 80kg (176\u00a0lb); if a dunk collapses on you it will be difficult to pull them off. They have small round legs that provide them minimal mobility. On average, they walk 2 mph (3 kph) and run at top speeds of 5 mph (8 kph). They have a long trunk in a shape resembling a human hand, though this trunk is not as advanced as a human hand and is similar to an elephant's trunk in behavior and anatomy.</p><br><p>Two sharp horns also grow from the top of their heads. These horns are made of keratin and grow over time. They have obtained their unique shape through a strange growing pattern that makes them twist and cross over each other. Wild dunks are known to rub their horns against rough surfaces to shave them down from time to time. Owners of tamed dunks are advised to shave down their horns occasionally, to prevent them from getting too large for the dunk to manage.</p><br><p>Interestingly, because of their passivity, people have been able to scrutinize the overall anatomy of dunks. This has revealed numerous oddities in their physiology. For example, dunks do not have mouths or even a digestive system. Instead, they seem to absorb light in their skin, undergoing photosynthesis like plants to obtain energy. Similarly, though dunks possess a musculoskeletal system similar in most respects to that of normal animals, they have a hexagonal pattern shaping their bones, which mechanically strengthens their signature cube-shaped skeleton. Dunks also have mostly functional muscles.</p><br><p>A dunk's most recognizable appendage is, of course, its long arm-shaped trunk. Their trunk can be used to feel and pick up items. The end of the trunk appears to contain specialized sensory nerves which react to being tapped, and are responsible for producing the biological mechanisms which change a dunk's behavior when it is tamed.</p><br><p>As a species, dunks have also proven to be very adaptable in new environments. They are known to reproduce by cloning themselves, producing forms suited to their surroundings. To clone itself, a Dunk will use a sharp object to tear off a tiny piece of their skin or chip off a piece of their horn. If possible, they will then hide the piece of skin/horn in a safe, secluded area within the level. After several minutes, the biological tissue will reform into a replica of the original Dunk with specific evolutionary adaptations suited to the region. This clone is an entirely distinct organism from the original Dunk, with a different appearance and personality.</p><br><p>Variants are the result of the dunk cloning process. Variants usually have a different color, a different personality, and adaptations to suit the environment they were created in. These clones can clone themselves as many times as they want, producing variants with increasingly effective niche adaptations. While most dunks are adventurous, variants with significant adaptational changes (generally speaking, variants resulting from the second or above cloning cycle away from a basic dunk) seem to mostly stay in their own environment and will not purposefully move across different levels. In addition, dunks seem to avoid darker environments because their energy is taken from light. However, some variants have been able to survive in darker levels, usually by absorbing far-red or artificial light.</p><br><p>Each variant is tamable and will behave like any average dunk would in most situations. Some variants include, but are not limited to:</p><br><p><strong>Snow Dunks:</strong></p><br><p>Artist's rendition of a 3rd stage Snow Dunk.</p><br><p><strong>Field Dunks:</strong></p><br><p>Artist's rendition of a 3rd stage Field Dunk.</p><br><p><strong>Stone Dunks:</strong></p><br><p>Artist's rendition of a 3rd stage Stone Dunk.</p><br><p><strong>Extra Variants:</strong></p><br><p>Dunks have been found throughout The Backrooms for quite a while. It is difficult to identify when exactly they were discovered, but photos and sketches of them have been commonly found in wanderers' journals. There are many carvings displaying them, some have featured unusual traits that the common dunk does not have. The majority of these drawings portray Dunks with mouths, ringed stripes around their trunk, and even with tails. It is unknown why these drawings contain these characteristics, but it is speculated that it has to do with their domestication.</p><br><p>The reason Dunk is domesticated is tied to the story of an elderly wanderer. Rumors would suggest that this wanderer specifically trained Dunks to follow orders. These Dunks would have cloned themselves with adaptations that made them more obedient and caused less trouble for their owners. Such adaptations would include photosynthesis or the taming nerves at the end of their trunks. This would explain why Dunks are so easily tamed, as this attitude would have been embedded in their species ever since they were first domesticated. It would also explain why Dunks refuse to attack anyone with an elderly appearance, as it would instinctively remind them of their original domesticator. Though there is no concrete proof for this, it has become the most popular theory on how dunks developed their subservient nature.</p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/entity-11\">Entity 11</a> | Entity 12 | <a href=\"/entity-13\">Entity 13</a> \u00bb</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/entity-12\">Entity 12 - \"Dunks\"</a>\" by BearPig, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

Their attention can be drawn towards a wanderer via visual or auditory contact. Once contacted, they will turn to stare and will attempt communication via sign language or by directing attention towards a sign reading \u201cTaxi Service\u201d in a variety of languages.</p><br><p>Expressing agreement via nodding or thumbs up will cause the Transporter to grab the wanderer with their hands and swiftly no-clip into the nearest wall. Transporters seem to travel through an as of yet unknown level only accessible by the entity itself. After a variable amount of time (3~5 minutes) Transporters will then drop off the wanderer into a level of their choosing expressed before agreeing to the Transporter\u2019s service. If they do not make these prior arrangements, the entity will bring them to a random level with a Survival Difficulty Class of 3 or below.</p><br><p>Transporters are humanoid entities with completely light absorbing skin, making them completely pitch black even in brightly lit environments. The only exception is a singular eye, which are humanoid and have similarly pitch black pupils like the rest of their body. They lack legs or a pelvis and constantly float 1.5 meters above the ground. Their arms in contrast are extremely long at 3 meters with 4 joints and long, multi-jointed fingers with at least 7 segments. Transporters seem to have the unique ability to voluntarily \"grow\" more arm and finger segments at will. This ability is poorly understood.</p><br><p>All Transporters wear long black coats and black pork pie hats with large, wide brims. These hats have a yellow and black checkered band wrapped around the centre. Their coats often drag across the floor, leading to some tears/fraying and grime around the bottom edges.</p><br><p>Entity 13 was discovered by an unaligned wanderer when they watched a person being taken by a Transporter in Level 131. As of writing this document, at least 20 wander experiences with Transporters have proven their honesty and safety as a means of travel across the Backrooms.</p><br><p><em>Note:</em> We talked in the combined sign these entities use.

    "description": "<p><strong>Reviooks</strong> are entities that can be found in the Backrooms, most commonly on <a href=\"/level-5\">Level 5</a> and <a href=\"/level-7\">Level 7</a>, characterized by their many legs and ability to burrow into the ground. These creatures should be considered extremely dangerous.</p><br><p>Reviooks will burrow into the ground for several weeks at a time, waiting for wanderers or other entities to walk over them. The ground will eventually heal, and look like it did before. After around 5-9 seconds of standing on the ground, the ground will begin to break, and the Reviook will break out of the floor and grab its victim, pulling it back underneath the floor. What happens at this point is unknown, but the victim may reemerge as a bare, brittle skeleton. It is assumed that the Reviook forces its victim to suffocate underground, and discards the remains.</p><br><p>The exact physical appearance of a Reviook is unclear, as they spend most of their existence underground. However, we do know what they generally look like. Large muscular arms in the front of the body, and three small legs in the back. The feet have a 'spork' like appearance, allowing them to dig into the ground in seconds. The head has several black beady eyes, and a small tube-like mouth underneath. Males will have large white spots on the body, while females will have several tiny white dots.</p><br><p>A man named Andrew Williams, a member of \"the Originals\", vanished from <a href=\"/level-5\">Level 5</a> for seemingly no reason.

    "title": "- \"Wretches\"",
    "description": "<p><strong>Wretches</strong> are a humanlike entity, often described as acting undead or zombielike. Once human, these entities were transformed via a poorly understood process, thought to stem from deprivation of vital sustenance such as food, water, and sleep. Wretches are common throughout the Backrooms, residing in the shadows wherever humans gather due to their nature.</p><br><p>The process of transformation into a Wretch appears to be related to hunger, thirst, and lack of sleep. Isolation is thought to accelerate the process, judging by the high concentration of Wretches in unexplored or dangerous areas. The process of transformation into a Wretch is commonly referred to as the \"Wretched Cycle\" among wanderers, and cannot be reversed by normal means. However, a transformation in process can be stalled by proper sustenance and rest, including <a href=\"/object-1\">Almond Water</a> and <a href=\"/object-16\">Royal Rations</a>.</p><br><p>Complete prevention of the process is possible, but rare and often risky. <a href=\"/object-24\">Wall Masks</a> are thought to reverse the transformation, at a cost; <a href=\"/object-32\">Reality Fresheners</a> are hypothesized to aid in prevention as well.</p><br><p>The \"Wretched Cycle\" lasts between several weeks to months, and has three phases, as follows:</p><br><p>The behavior of an average Wretch is comparable to <a href=\"/entity-10\">Entity 10</a>, possessing little intelligence but astounding strength. Rarely, however, Wretches have displayed intelligent or even humanlike behavior, able to craft or wield weapons. In packs, Wretches often act in unison, behaving as a hivemind. Weaker Wretches exist, but the majority possess superhuman strength, often able to break through walls, despite their fragile, skeletal appearance. The speed of Wretches varies as well, ranging from a slow shamble to sprints surpassing human capabilities.</p><br><p>Vocalizations are the fastest and most reliable way to determine the threat level of a Wretch. Many Wretches produce gurgling and snarling sounds often and with little apparent purpose; low-pitched and slow sounds often indicate an unintelligent variant, while high-pitched vocalizations are often intelligent or unusually quick. This method is not always accurate, but it is the only reliable means of gauging danger at this time.</p><br><p>Like their behavior, the appearance of a <strong>Wretch</strong> often varies greatly. A fully infected body will have reddish-brown skin that is dry and flaky, covered in holes and pustules secreting a thick red-brown substance. Wretches are often skeletal in appearance, belying a great potential strength and resilience; larger Wretches have been rarely seen.</p><br><p>Remains of the past human identity of a Wretch are difficult to discern, but visible if closely observed; most often, keepsakes such as clothing, supplies, and personal belongings will remain on the body, though often mutilated beyond recognition.</p><br><p>Mutations are frequent in Wretches, often resulting in misplaced eyes, disjointed or excess limbs, or even fleshy, skeletal \"wings\". A common and formidable variant manifests as a deformed mass of flesh, consisting almost entirely of eyes, mouths, and other orifices of unknown purpose.</p><br><p><strong>Wretches</strong> were first discovered during an encounter with a Base on <a href=\"/level-2\">Level 2</a> known as \"The Survivors\". The early <a href=\"/the-m-e-g\">M.E.G.</a> was able to aid the Group in killing the Wretch and delivering it to Base Alpha in <a href=\"/archived:level-0\">Level 0</a><sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup>. The initial log can be found here: <a href=\"/m-e-g-the-discovery-of-the-wretch\">M.E.G. The Discovery Of The Wretch</a>.</p><br><p>After the initial encounter, Wretches have been observed more often, becoming one of the most formidable known entities. Many Wanderers have been taken by the Wretched Cycle, and many have been saved from its grasp. It is your duty as a Backrooms Wanderer to maintain your health as closely as possible, resting and sustaining yourself with any means safely available.</p><br><p>This is a detailed report of a new event involving the Wretch entity. Methods to stop the effect detailed are being researched with all means available.</p><br><p><strong>Begin Log: 10:03</strong><br/>\n<strong>Team Involved:</strong> M.E.G.

Volunteer Squad soon arrived to find a barely living Wretch on the floor, with Nari next to Mat's unconscious body. Mat survived the ordeal and will be back to work in a few weeks.<br/>\nIt has been found that the brown sludge produced by fully developed Wretches can cause one to transform into a Wretch within a few minutes after contact. The effect is seemingly rare, but Kenny of regiment Wild Warriors was sadly lost to the effects of The Wretched Cycle, and the process is being further researched.</p><br><p><strong>End Log: 10:14</strong></p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/entity-14\">Entity 14</a> | Entity 15 | <a href=\"/entity-16\">Entity 16</a> \u00bb</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/entity-15\">Entity 15 - \"Wretches\"</a>\" by Stretchsterz and etoisle, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

While a close encounter with it is highly dangerous, not only are they slow, but they also aren't observed to chase prey. As long as you steer clear of its traps, they are essentially harmless.</p><br><p>They generally stay hidden on ceilings, creating ball-shaped webs and filling them with a sedative that while unable to completely paralyze a victim, is enough to greatly dampen a person's thinking capability. It then hangs these balls on the ceiling with additional webbing. It continues to do this when there is no prey nearby.</p><br><p>On smaller prey (i.e. other bugs), it simply spurts the chemical and then starts to eat the prey. On humans, however, It stays completely still to not be noticed. When the wanderer is directly below its traps, it proceeds to cut down a single ball. The ball then bursts out the sedative onto the target. Most targets will not notice the first one, but will start to feel weird.</p><br><p>The effect of the depressant starts and the victim will start to feel less aware of their surroundings. It then proceeds to drop all of the balls at once, eventually making the target completely unresponsive to any outside stimuli. The Nguithr'xurh then drops down to its prey and proceeds to eat it alive. After feeding, it returns to the nearest possible ceiling and hibernates before setting up its traps once again.</p><br><p>Nguithr'xurhs are currently classified as an Arachnid under the Solifugae order.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> Sizes vary greatly, but the average size of a Nguithr'xurh is estimated to be around 4 inches wide and 7 inches in length.</p><br><p>It is believed that Reddit user u/Lordmac29 was the first to discover Entity 16 after a short message containing a considerable amount of spelling and grammatical errors was sent to a M.E.G. member. As the message was near incomprehensible aside from the words \"spider\" and \"sixteen legs\", no investigation was made, as it was thought at the time that u/Lordmac29 was under the effects of some recreational substance.</p><br><p>The first recorded sighting of Entity 16 was from a team of M.E.G. Explorers on a mission unrelated to the said entity. They have set up a base directly underneath a family of Nguithr'xurhs, and by the time they realized what was going on, 2 members have already been fatally injured and were unable to recover. The team immediately went back to a safe base and recorded the incident and the entity.</p><br><p>The first version of this entry was created by a M.E.G. Explorer that was, unknown to them, was still under the heavy sedation effects of the Entity 16 secretion. The name for Entity 16 was supposed to either be the 'Sleeper' or 'The Sleeper Spider', but the name 'Nguithr'xurh' was typed instead. The name stayed this way as a reminder of how powerful the sedation effect could get.</p><br><p>While the entity itself is dangerous due to its size, its secretion is found to be very harmless, even in large doses. Research is currently ongoing to create highly effective painkillers, antidepressants, and other beneficial drugs that people within the backrooms are in desperate need of.</p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/entity-15\">Entity 15</a> | Entity 16 | <a href=\"/entity-17\">Entity 17</a> \u00bb</p><br><p><br/></p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/entity-16\">Entity 16 - \"Nguithr'xurh\"</a>\" by unknown author, rewritten by zakkun_, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

    "description": "<p><strong>Crawlers</strong> are the collective name for all those affected by a certain, somewhat anomalous species of fungus. This fungus' growth is extremely aggressive, and the infection is present in abundance on many levels. Therefore, this makes <strong>Crawlers</strong> an extremely active threat in the Backrooms.</p><br><p>The <strong>Crawler</strong> fungus can only spread to humans through liquid, and thrives in warm, dark, and damp places. It can only spread by contact to small animals or insects that are affected by it. Once these animals or insects reach Stage 4 of the infection, they will become extremely aggressive, and will attempt to spread the fungus through any means necessary. You may be bitten by an infected individual, which means that the fungus has already spread to you. There is no known cure to the <strong>Crawler</strong> infection.</p><br><p><strong>Crawler</strong> fungus can be characterized by bright white buildup on an animal's body. This fungus is visually similar to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torrubiella\" target=\"_blank\">Torrubiella Pulvinata</a> fungus: a strain of cordyceps fungi which zombifies and infects cellar spider. It will attempt to engulf the entire body of the animal in the substance, slowly consuming its energy and nutrients for growth purposes. Spores are released in liquid substances such as blood, saliva, urine, or sweat, and as such it is recommended to patch your wounds to avoid infection.</p><br><p><strong>Crawler</strong> infected animals do not progress past Stage 4. However, these are extremely aggressive towards humans and will actively try to infect as many humans as possible through liquid exposure.</p><br><p>Once humans are infected, they will progress from Stage 1 to Stage 5 at around 12 minutes following initial infection. This time period is extraordinarily short for complete infection, therefore it is recommended to quarantine all infected immediately to reduce spread of the <strong>Crawler</strong> infection.</p><br><p><strong>Crawlers</strong> will have various behaviors ranging from normal behavior to aggressive based on their stage of infection.</p><br><p>Not much is known about the biological structure of the <strong>Crawler</strong> fungus, however they are assumed to be able to increase and decrease temperature around them at will. Similarities between this infection and <a href=\"/the-frontrooms\">The Frontrooms</a> genus Cordyceps have been drawn, however it has not been scientifically proven if this is a member of the Cordyceps genus or a unique species endemic to the Backrooms.</p><br><p><strong>Crawlers</strong> were discovered in 2009 when <a href=\"/the-m-e-g\">The M.E.G.'s</a> Base Alpha was raided by several Stage 5 <strong>Crawlers</strong>. The infected individuals were immediately killed by gunfire. However, some individuals were infected later and a <strong>Crawler</strong> pandemic has been running rampant throughout the Backrooms since. It is thought that <strong>Crawlers</strong> were not present on other levels before, however infection has caused it to spread to the majority of levels in the Backrooms.</p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/entity-16\">Entity 16</a> | Entity 17 | <a href=\"/entity-18\">Entity 18</a> \u00bb</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/entity-17\">Entity 17 - \"Crawlers\"</a>\" by unknown author, rewritten by Uberspective, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

When two nurses came to assess the situation, they saw Mr. Johnson covered in blood. He was bleeding profusely from his arms, abdomen and right thigh. He tried to get up to no avail, but the two nurses, aided by the patient's friend, managed to apply tourniquets. The patient fainted due to blood loss in the process.</p><br><p><strong>Aftermath:</strong> The area was quarantined in view of the bacteriological tests carried out in the days leading up to the incident. Mr. Johnson's comrade does not appear to be in any psychological distress. All three individuals were decontaminated and allowed to leave the quarantine zone. Mr. Johnson was declared comatose a few hours later. An in-depth study of the pathogen found on Mr. Johnson began in order to better understand its nature and how it could be treated.</p><br><p><br/></p><br><p><strong>From:</strong> <span class=\"wiki-email\">rb.901level|nosaM.rehsiF#rb.901level|nosaM.rehsiF</span><br/>\n<strong>to:</strong> <span class=\"wiki-email\">rb.901level|sinneD.nottuS#rb.901level|sinneD.nottuS</span><br/>\n<strong>On: [corrupted data]</strong><br/>\n<strong>Subject:</strong> Unknown disease?</p><br><p>Hi Dennis,</p><br><p>Sorry, I've only just seen your emails after the incident. This is indeed a very big problem. It's impossible for us to regulate the travelers going to the Pipe Dimension because of the lack of communication between the rare communities within the Dimensions between the rare outposts. Nevertheless, we're going to have to deal with this infection as best we can. If a new patient appears, the disease is likely to spread very quickly, and the hospital could be doomed. A large part of the medical staff has been mobilized to analyze the blood samples in hopes that we can understand what's going on before it's too late.</p><br><p>I remain available should any problems arise,</p><br><p>Mason Fisher</p><br><p><br/></p><br><p>The technicians in the cultivation room set about their tasks with a haste that seemed unusual. Among them, Dennis was probably the most worried. He was the one who delivered the strange culture results. He was the one connected to the patient's unusual story that was making rounds of the hospital. A peculiar but anxiety-provoking story of blood, screams, and an unknown disease with seemingly devastating effects. Dennis knew this story far too well, although he hadn't been there at the time. He had quickly made the connection between \"the bloody man in room 245\" and Dr. Fisher's patient. At first, he didn't want to believe it. The results he'd sent back were certainly strange. But he didn't want to admit that he'd had in his hands not only the most resistant strain he'd ever analyzed, but also the most dangerous.<br/>\nDr. Fisher and the other doctors quickly took charge, despite the distant look they had given Dennis' messages in earlier days. Half of the unit Dennis was in was now working shoulder to shoulder with him, analyzing the samples recovered from the patient after the event. Numerous agar Petri dishes of various compositions were being prepared simultaneously, with the staff unsure of which path to follow. Dennis, for his part, was preparing several antibiograms with the strain, looking glum. He knew it- he knew that everyone here was thinking the same thing, but didn't want to admit it: the bacteria wasn't anything they knew. Despite all their efforts, identification was simply impossible.<br/>\nThey were in no way equipped to study new strains. In fact, Dennis doubted the very existence of a research unit in these dimensions. Their only hope was that, somehow, the disease would remain confined to this unfortunate patient. A bleak prospect indeed, but still more optimistic than the contamination of multiple staff representatives, or worse, other dimensions. He sighed as he closed the three Petri dishes containing the antibiograms he'd just performed. He rose to his feet, narrowly dodging one of his companions who was hurrying towards the cabinet containing the Petri dishes, then headed for the incubators to place his work.<br/>\nSuddenly, the hospital sirens sounded for the first time in years.<br/>\nAnd Dennis never made it to said incubators, realizing to his horror what was happening.</p><br><p><br/></p><br><p><span class=\"titlebox\">Evacuation alert recording of <strong>[corrupted data]</strong></span></p><br><p><strong>This is a level 5 contamination alert. This is not a drill.</strong></p><br><p><br/></p><br><p><strong>Please leave your rooms or stations and proceed immediately to the nearest no-clip area with your supervisor or team leader. If you are contaminated, please remain where you are and wait for qualified personnel to arrive, whereupon you will be placed in isolation.</strong></p><br><p><br/></p><br><p><strong>I repeat: This is not a drill.</strong></p><br><p><br/></p><br><p><br/></p><br><p><br/></p><br><p>Second passage on the right. Next corridor.<br/>\nAlthough never used, the emergency procedure was common knowledge.<br/>\nStraight on, through the sampling room corridor.<br/>\nWhen the emergency bell rang, the entire team was to exit and calmly make their way to the nearest no-clip point.<br/>\nStraight ahead, then left at the T-junction.<br/>\nThe point closest to the laboratory was naturally connected to the <a href=\"/level-173\">Flooded Cavern Dimension</a>. A small community had recently settled there and would be able to host them for some time before the Hospital Dimension could be decontaminated.<br/>\nTurn left at the T-junction.<br/>\nJust as he was about to follow his colleagues into the next section of the corridor, Dennis was startled by the sound of an inhuman voice piercing the blaring sirens. He turned back to the right-hand side of the crossing, astonished. What he saw there chilled his blood, making him realize the scale of the disaster that was unfolding today.<br/>\nAbout ten meters ahead, the technician discerned the spasming body of an orderly covered in blood. The unfortunate man was screaming at the top of his lungs as two men in protective suits tried to immobilize him.<br/>\nDennis, shaking all over, had just grasped the gravity of the situation. The bacteria had spread over the last few days without anyone noticing, bypassing the meagre safeguards the Dimensions provided.<br/>\nHe turned around, but couldn't make out any of his colleagues, who had continued on their way.<br/>\nFear gripped him. Could he end up bleeding to death here, having failed to reach the exit before it closed?<br/>\nDennis dashed through the corridors, trying to catch up with the rest of his group.<br/>\nStraight ahead.<br/>\nLeft into the storeroom.<br/>\nPassing the bend to the first cluster of rooms.<br/>\nOut of breath, Dennis managed to make out a human form that seemed to be crossing the wall in front of him.<br/>\nThe no-clip point.<br/>\nHe called out, but there was no answer, the person having already crossed the threshold.<br/>\nDespite his fatigue, he redoubled his willpower, trying to wait for the invisible portal before it was sealed on the other side.</p><br><p><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/></p><br><p>\u2026</p><br><p><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/></p><br><p><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/></p><br><p><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">I\u2026 I don't really know where to start. So much has happened in the last few hours.</span><br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">I guess I'll pick up where I left off with the alert.</span><br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">It's taken us all by surprise, of course. For many of us, it was the first time we'd heard it, but it was the mention of \"alert level five\" that really chilled us.</span><br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">Well, it probably doesn't mean anything to you, but when you arrive here as a technician, you're trained in everything to do with safety here. And part of that is evacuation alerts. They go from one to five, and five is the one that represents massive, out-of-control contamination of the entire dimension.</span><br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">The procedure, we knew it, even if we'd all buried it in the darkest corner of our memory because the prospect of it happening seemed so impossible. \"Stop everything you're doing and head for the nearest no-clip point\". For us, that was the point that lead to the <a href=\"/level-173\">Flooded Cave Dimension</a>. But the path was the most traumatic experience we'd ever had. People were running everywhere. Screams could be heard from a distance from personnel who had been infected and were now bleeding as Carl Johnson had bled.</span><br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">But no one could come to their rescue. Even the security staff- those who were supposed to put them in isolation were fleeing the hospital. I don't know where Mason no-clipped, although Im confident he and the other doctors made it. We closed the no-clip's access right after passage, as procedure required, to prevent the infected from following and contaminating us.</span><br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">I don't know what to think. I've lived and worked in the Hospital Dimension for eight years. It's all\u2026 unreal. That feeling I had\u2026 I never thought it would really change. That everything would change so much.</span><br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">The others are kind of depressed too. The Flooded Cave Camp picked us up. They were as worried as we were, not understanding what was going on. We explained the situation to them, but they didn't believe it at first. To tell the truth, we didn't believe it either. Now they're quite suspicious. I can understand that. They're afraid of being infected themselves, even though we explained that none of us had seen any bleeding. In the end, they welcomed us despite all their fears.</span><br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">I don't know how the rest is going to work out. I'll have to contact Mason again. The Hospital Dimension must not be deserted. We've got to get it under control. The Dimensions are hostile, the travelers need us. We're going to have to decontaminate, and our lack of knowledge is going to be our greatest enemy.</span><br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">I assume only a few rooms are contaminated beyond control? Either way, we're going to have to sort it out.</span><br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">Well, it's late already, and to be honest all this has tired me out. I hope it all gets better.</span></p><br><p><br/></p><br><p>Dennis put down his journal and his body felt heavy on his assigned sleeping bag. The floor was hard. He was no longer used to sleeping outside his room in the Hospital Dimension. In fact, he was no longer used to leaving the hospital. The last few hours had drained him of all his energy. He was hot, he was flushed, he was stressed. Dennis was not prepared for this kind of situation. The routine he'd established for himself had broken down and he was totally disoriented as a result. He hoped that Mason had pulled through and that he and the other doctors would take matters into their own hands and reinvest in the hospital. They had to. The stakes were far too high.<br/>\nHe was so hot. He was so red.<br/>\nHis limbs hurt.<br/>\nAnd as he began to drift off to sleep, Dennis Sutton almost felt his blood running down his left arm.</p><br><p><br/></p><br><p><br/></p><br><p><strong><tt>&gt; User @katyaaaaaaaaa576 created the room.</tt></strong></p><br><p><strong><tt>&gt; User @katyaaaaaaaaa576 entered the room.</tt></strong></p><br><p><strong><tt>&gt; User @someoneintheroom entered the room.</tt></strong></p><br><p><strong><tt>[someoneintheroom]:</tt></strong> Hey, remember that bleeding disease thing?</p><br><p><strong><tt>[katyaaaaaaaaa576]:</tt></strong> Don't remind me, I'm on the case and it's\u2026 Complicated</p><br><p><strong><tt>[katyaaaaaaaaa576]:</tt></strong> Like why did they give me this?

    "description": "<p><strong>Entity 20</strong>, referred to as Scits, are a small crustaceous species that stem from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomalocarididae\">Anomalocarididae family</a> \u2014 which went extinct in the <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-frontrooms\">Frontrooms</a> around 448 million years ago. Scits infest almost every known level of the Backrooms \u2014 with the only currently known level to not contain any being <a href=\"/level-6\">Level 6</a>. Due to how common they are, alongside their edibility, scits have become one of the primary forms of nutrition in the Backrooms.</p><br><p>Unlike most other species from the Anomalocarididae family \u2014 which were known for being large predators during their time \u2014 scits are completely harmless entities, posing absolutely zero threat to wanderers. They are passive creatures that absentmindedly roam around the Backrooms, with seemingly no goal or destination. It has been observed that other entities such as <a href=\"/entity-5\">clumps</a>, <a href=\"/entity-8\">hounds</a>, <a href=\"/entity-9\">facelings</a>, <a href=\"/entity-10\">skin-stealers</a>, and <a href=\"/entity-15\">wretches</a> are not aggressive towards scits. However, entities such as <a href=\"/entity-4\">deathmoths</a>, <a href=\"/entity-6\">dullers</a>, and <a href=\"/entity-14\">Reviooks</a> act extremely aggressively on sight, oftentimes ending in the consumption of the scit. It is currently unknown why some creatures act aggressive towards scits, while others do not \u2014 further research into the matter is actively being conducted.</p><br><p>Image of an Anomalocaris.</p><br><p>Physically, scits are identical to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomalocaris\">Anomalocaris</a> \u2014 the largest part of the Anomalocarididae family. However, the two vastly differ in other aspects; such as habitat, diet and behavior.</p><br><p>One of the largest differences between the two creatures is their mental capabilities. The Anomalocaris were thought to be an extremely smart species, as well as great hunters, earning them the title of one of the earliest examples of an apex predator. Scits however, are the exact opposite, to such a degree that many have called into question if the creatures are even sentient beings. This debate of sentience is caused by the behaviors of the creatures, consisting of roaming around aimlessly and seemingly nothing more. The creatures have shown no need for food, water or other forms of energy, nor do they seem to have a purpose or goal in their movements.</p><br><p>Another large difference between the two species is their habitats, as the Anomalocarididae family is comprised of aquatic creatures. Scits on the other hand, have been shown to survive on land and in water, making them closer to an amphibious creature than a crustacean.</p><br><p>One of the more interesting properties of scits is its ability to be safely eaten raw. This property is what makes scits one of the most useful creatures within the Backrooms, providing a quick and widely available form of nutrients.</p><br><p>Similar to many other entities, scits appear to be unable to or wish not to reproduce. However, unlike most other entities \u2014 which simply appear and disappear at random \u2014 scits undergo a process similar to mitosis, allowing the creatures to create exact carbon copies of themselves. It is presumed that this ability is what lead to the infestation of the creatures throughout the Backrooms.</p><br><p>The earliest report of an instance of <strong>Entity 20</strong> was on <em>7/3/2013</em>, by a member of the newly formed group called the M.E.G. The wanderer had spotted three of them while exploring The Beverly Room on <a href=\"/level-5\">Level 5</a>. They soon after contacted the division head overseeing the establishment of M.E.G. Outpost \"House Keeping\" for further inquiry into the creature.</p><br><p>Below is the email chain between the wanderer \u2014 Mrs. Elena Keller \u2014 and the division head \u2014 Mrs. John Millar.

    "description": "<p>Entity 22, also known as Warning Kites, refers to a group of kites of childish design. Each kite varies in size and design. Without a cause, Entity 22 cannot be spotted or manifested. When danger is near a Wanderer, Entity 22 will then warn the Wanderer of the oncoming danger. These entities can be found on any outdoor level and are directly proportional to the danger level of the wanderers surroundings.</p><br><p>When danger is more than an acre of a Wanderer, Entity 22 will manifest in hordes of indeterminate amounts. They then can be seen flying in the opposite direction of the danger. This is their way of telling the Wanderer which direction the danger is in. When directly overhead of a Wanderer, childish laughter and cheering can be heard. The louder the sounds produced from Entity 22 are, the closer the danger is.</p><br><p>Entity 22 is completely neutral towards humans and will make no attempt at harming an individual. However, when warning a Wanderer, they will also not make any attempt to stop the danger other than only warning the aforementioned individual.</p><br><p>Depending on the quantity of the danger<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup>, the quantity of Entity 22 will increase. The opposite goes for the fewer amounts of danger.</p><br><p>When out of range<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')\">3</a></sup>, Entity 22 will explode, releasing confetti from its interior and producing a sound similar to children cheering.</p><br><p>Entity 22 is constructed of a metal mesh outline and nylon fabric. There are strings attached to the bottoms of the kites that lead to an unknown location. During thorough tests, it has been concluded that these kites have some form of nerve endings capable of receiving pain and touch. Otherwise, all characteristics of Entity 22 are the same as a typical kite.</p><br><p>On 05/28/21, Entity 22 was first discovered on Level 10 when a Wanderer was in close proximity to two <a href=\"/entity-10\">Skin-Stealers</a>. The Wanderer later heard a group of children cheering and looked up to find a horde of kites flying away from the Skin Stealers. The Wanderer followed the kites and ended up surviving until the M.E.G. recovered him.</p><br><p><span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/s-n-o-w-y\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6723882); return false;\"><img alt=\"s n o w y\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=6723882&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334083\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=6723882)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/s-n-o-w-y\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6723882); return false;\">s n o w y</a></span></p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/entity-21\">Entity 21</a> | Entity 22 | <a href=\"/entity-23\">Entity 23</a> \u00bb</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/entity-22\">Entity 22</a>\" by s n o w y, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

    "title": "- \"Unapproachable Horse\"",
    "description": "<p>Entity 23 takes the appearance of a dark-brown horse of unknown gender and age. The entity has been sighted on a variety of levels, but it's most commonly seen on levels that take the appearance of natural spaces, such as forests and fields. It is unknown if the entity has the same movement restraints as wanders, as it has been sighted on a large variety of disparate levels without ever being seen to no-clip between them.</p><br><p>The entity has a unique property in it's never able to be approached. At all times, the area with a radius of 40 meters (130 feet) around the horse is completely inaccessible. The mechanism that prevents wanderers from approaching the horse is not understood at this time, with any wanderers who attempt to approach the entity reporting that they are still able to walk or run towards the entity but never get any closer to it.</p><br><p>Additionally, any time the horse moves in the direction of wanderers or entities, those that end up in the horse's area of effect are physically displaced to an area beyond it, sometimes clipping through walls and other solid objects. Although this occurrence appears to an outside observer like wanderers or entities being physically pushed by an invisible wall, wanderers who have been affected by this don't feel as if they are being moved but rather that their environment is being moved around them.</p><br><p>Entity 23 is a horse of unknown gender, breed, and age. Its coat is brown, and it has a black mane and tail. It is assumed that the entity requires food and water, as many reports of the entity discuss it either grazing on grass or attempting to drink from streams that it comes across. Due to the nature of Entity 23 and the impossibility of getting close enough to it for examination, many aspects of its biology cannot be discerned.</p><br><p>Entity 23 acts like a normal horse, usually not taking particular notice of its unusual effect. It will usually spend its time in natural levels, grazing or wandering. Entity 23 has shown signs of loneliness, such as restlessness and calling for other horses, though it is not able to approach any animals or humans due to its effect. The entity occasionally has episodes of distress in which it runs through levels at high speeds. This can occasionally be dangerous or unsettling due to nearby wanderers due to the spatial displacement caused by the approaching horse.</p><br><p>The first reports of the entity come from a sighting in Alcatraz Park on <a href=\"/level-11\">Level 11</a>, where its unique property was first documented. Due to the property, no one was able to enter the park, and they were only able to see the entity briefly, calling it the \u201cghost horse\u201d. After some time, it eventually left the park, only to enter a state of distress and charge quickly through the level, causing many of the witnesses to experience spatial displacement. M.E.G. operatives from Base Beta attempted to capture the entity with no success. The entity eventually left the level once all attention was taken away from it. This is the only known event of the entity in a heavily populated level, and there have been no further reports of the entity in Level 11 since its discovery.</p><br><p>A single horse stands alone in the middle of a field. Alone. A quality that need not be specified because it is a quality that has plagued the horse's entire existence. As long-rusted neurons make connections in the horse's brain, a face forms in the deep vacuum that is memory. Perhaps the quality of \"alone\" did not always apply to the horse, but it has applied for as long as the horse can remember. As long as it can bear to remember.</p><br><p>The rain above picks up, beating into the horse's skin with minuscule fists, and the horse begins to remember a time before. Before it was irredeemable. Before it was unapproachable. Before it was alone. The face in the horse's memory begins to take shape, eclipsing all other thought, and as it sees a young boy in its mind's eye, a deep sorrow washes over it, reminding it of all the pain. All the hardship. And even more painful, of a time when it was happy, that terrible feeling of contentment that it will never feel again.</p><br><p>But the memories continue flooding back, against the horse's wishes. They are now a fully formed being, outside of the horse's control, surrounding it, suffocating it, and leading it again on this path as an unwilling participant in its own past.</p><br><p>\"Pferdnando, I think we're almost there,\" the young boy says from the horse's back.</p><br><p>The horse says nothing in reply, for it is a horse, and horses don't generally speak. The rain continues to beat down on the horse's skin, but the boy seems unaffected. As they will both find, they were not almost there. The horse grows weary as the night grows deeper.</p><br><p>\"Let us stop here, Pferdnando, and take a bit of rest.\" The boy motions for the horse to slow its pace, and it does.</p><br><p>The boy dismounts, sitting on a nearby rock as the horse stands idly by, examining the faint silhouettes of trees and hills that can barely be made out in the evening light. Twigs can be heard breaking, as a small doe flits gracefully across the forest floor until an enormous booming explosion rattles the trees around and the doe's fur is shrouded in a viscous blackness that leaks out from its chest.</p><br><p>The boy stands still in the shock of a gunshot so close, but the horse's glassy eyes are blind with rage. It rushes towards a large man not far away, which it recognizes as the source of the blast, quickly approaching his position. The hunter shoots once at the horse in shock, missing it by a large margin as the shot continues behind it, and the horse knocks him over. Hoof meets skull, and grey matter leaks into the mud too fast to be washed away by the rain.</p><br><p>The horse turns around at a gurgling sound from behind it to see that the boy had been hit by the hunter's stray shot. Skull fragments are embedded into the sky like stars in the spot above where the boy's head once was. No. No. No. No. No. No. No.</p><br><p>A single tear rushes down the horse's face, as it pushes the memories away from its mind, but the boy from inside them is still there.</p><br><p>\"It's okay, Pferdnando,\" the boy says from beside the horse. \"You have to let go, now. I know it's hard to deal with the pain, Pferdnando, but you must forgive yourself because, well\u2026 there's no other way for you to keep on going. The pain you have inside you. This pain you've been carrying for so long, we all feel that pain, to some extent, and if you stop pushing people away, then you'll find that they can help you.\"</p><br><p>The boy fades away. He's done all he can.</p><br><p>The horse gives it some thought through its tears. Perhaps just this once, just for tonight, it will try to bring down its walls.</p><br><p>The horse makes its way through the empty streets of Spawntown and comes across a man. In the darkness, the man looks almost like the boy from the horse's past, though the horse knows that this is not so. The man looks surprised, at first, but he recognizes the horse's pain, senses the things that are ripping their way through the creature. The man wraps his arms around the horse and gives it a hug.</p><br><p>But the horse feels nothing. Is this all it is? After all the pain, after all the loneliness, it's finally feeling the contact that it had isolated itself from for so long, that it had desperately hoped would make everything go away, make the suffering numb for just a little bit longer, and this is all it is?

    "description": "<p><strong>Death Rats</strong> are Entities that can be found in various Levels of The Backrooms. With each population being unique depending on the Level it's on (Example: There is a species of <strong>Death Rat</strong> that is hairless to better cope with the hot temperature of <a href=\"/level-2\">Level 2</a>). They seem to have inhabited the Backrooms for many years, starting out as normal rats and slowly changing to better suit their climate.</p><br><p><strong>Death Rats</strong> vary in abilities, as they evolve their bodies and abilities to adapt to various Levels. (Example: In most levels like <a href=\"/level-1\">Level 1</a>, the Entities seem to have this \"Screaming Event\". On rare occasions, you can hear screaming, not from people, but from Rats chasing other Entities. Lights will flicker during this event, until the <strong>Death Rat</strong> stops or the Entity is terminated.) There are many other types of special <strong>Death Rat</strong>, but most <strong>Death Rats</strong> are harmless and can be a food source if your willing to eat one. Somehow. However, some species are very dangerous and will even set traps for you. They are smarter than you think.</p><br><p>The biology of <strong>Death Rats</strong> depend on the Level they inhabit, but some <strong>Death Rats</strong> can look very similar. The most common form looks like a normal house rat, with a long body, and black fur. They also have strange brown horns coming out of their head, that has a red glow on the tips. Most <strong>Death Rats</strong> have a diet consisting of Male <a href=\"/entity-4\">Deathmoths</a> and Mold, although most of them can hunt and kill other Entities (see 'Screaming Event' mentioned above).</p><br><p>It is unknown how these Entities were discovered, but a group known as <a href=\"/the-lost\">The Lost</a> referenced them as 'The Forever Changing Rodents' in their ancient texts.</p><br><p>The original author of this entry is an Anonymous Fandom/Reddit User.</p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/entity-23\">Entity 23</a> | Entity 24 | <a href=\"/entity-25\">Entity 25</a> \u00bb</p><br>",

    "description": "<p><strong>Plague Goblins</strong>, named after their superficial resemblance to medieval plague doctors are small, elusive, feline-avian entities that scurry about the Backrooms. They are opportunistic pack-based foragers that while usually timid and inoffensive, can be a major nuisance for explorers, especially those who travel alone.</p><br><p><strong>Plague Goblins'</strong> behaviors vary depending on their environment, but naturally they are cautious yet opportunistic creatures. Scavenging on whatever they find lying about from food, scraps of wood and metal, supplies, and sometimes even bones and body parts of deceased explorers and entities. These are stashed away in the <strong>Plague Goblin's</strong> cloak and seemingly disappear without a trace, regardless of the size and weight of the said object. Once areas have been cleared, they move on in search of new foraging locations. Alone <strong>Plague Goblin</strong> will usually flee at the sight of humans or entities, it's not uncommon for a group to try and steal from unsuspecting explorers when given the chance (particularly those traveling alone, weak, or old). These groups typically range from 9 to 27 members and are referred to as a <em>swindle</em>.</p><br><p><em>Swindles</em> of <strong>Plague Goblins</strong> will appear within an entry point, most preferably ones situated away from hostile entities within an area of approximately 200-500m. The <em>swindles</em> are divided into three castes, each with its own distinct role and function; The <em>scouts</em>, the <em>henchmen</em>, and the <em>gatekeepers</em>.</p><br><p>Serving as the reconnaissance for the <em>swindle</em>, <em>scouts</em> can be identified by their dark leather masks with glass openings over the eyes and consist of both males and females. At the sight of danger, they will retreat to warn the rest of the <strong>Plague Goblins</strong>. Proceed with caution, as an ambush may follow after.</p><br><p>The basic grunt of the <strong>Plague goblins</strong>, the heavy lifters, performing most of the non-combative foraging and standard labor. They are comprised of mostly adult males, but young females have been documented. They can be identified by having smooth light brown or white masks lacking distinctive features. These are the most numerous caste member and are always seen in the group.</p><br><p>The leading force behind the <em>swindle</em> is made up exclusively of adult females. <em>Gatekeepers</em> can be distinguished for wearing a wide-brim hat and more refined capes. They adorn highly decorated masks with distinct patterns. Each wields a silver cane tipped with an hourglass, though this isn't always the case. The <em>gatekeeper</em> uses this device to produce a portal from which the <em>swindle</em> enters and leaves. How it is capable of doing so is currently unknown.</p><br><p><strong>Plague Goblins</strong>, while typically nomadic entities, do build permanent lodgings at stable levels. These settlements are referred to by travelers as <em>wards</em>. <em>Wards</em> consist of tents built from various items the <strong>Plague Goblins</strong> have collected. Items include; camping equipment, bones and skins, wood, and various fabrics and beddings. There can be from 100 to 500 individual <strong>Plague Goblins</strong> in a single <em>ward</em>. It is ill-advised to try and steal from or break into a <em>ward</em>. They are heavily fortified and stocked with traps to ensnare would-be trespassers. The residing <strong>Plague Goblins</strong> will also retaliate with extreme aggression and violence. This usually leads to severe injuries and even the death of the said intruder.</p><br><p><strong>Plague Goblins</strong> communicate through raspy croaks, squawks, and chattering sounds. Those on more hazardous levels rely on complex hand gestures and visual cues. <strong>Plague Goblins</strong> have known to be capable of understanding human speech. In rare instances, some may sometimes attempt to mimic it to moderate success. This has led to some explorers bartering, and even befriending some <strong>Plague Goblins</strong>. They, in turn, would provide the travelers with supplies and warn them of potential danger.</p><br><p><strong>Plague Goblins</strong> are averse to other entities and are usually a sign that a specific area is safe. Yet, it is not uncommon for them to fall prey to specific hostile entities that roam the Backrooms. The prominent of which is <strong>Hounds</strong> as they are some of the few entities fast and agile enough to catch them. For this reason, <strong>Plague Goblins</strong> have developed a fear and hatred for this specific entity. Some travelers have reported swindles utilizing traps and weapons to hunt <strong>Hounds</strong>. Be sure to carry <strong>Hound</strong> parts with you to ensure safe passage with any swindles you may encounter.</p><br><p><strong>Plague Goblins</strong> are cat-sized semi-bipedal entities that resemble a cross between a bird and mammal, weighing 8-17lbs (3.6-7.7kg) on average. Females are generally larger than males but are visually identical otherwise. Soft, black, insulating fur-like feathers cover the entity's body. Their scaly limbs sport strong dexterous talons for climbing, holding objects, and defending themselves. Beneath the mask is a corvid-like beak full of razor-sharp serrated teeth. The eyes are enormous and very reflective, with a bright yellow shimmer in the dark. They sport two long, thin, tufted ears used to detect sound to communicate.</p><br><p>Despite their mammalian appearance, the <strong>Plague Goblins'</strong> internal structure is identical to birds. Traits include air sacs attached to the lungs, a crop and gizzard, hollow bones, and a small keel. This allows <strong>Plague Goblins</strong> to run at incredibly high speeds over long distances. While measurements have been difficult, the highest speed ever recorded was 52mph (84kmph). This combined with their agility makes them one of the most elusive entities in the Backrooms. If killed, the meat and organs are clean and palatable and can be safely eaten raw or cooked.</p><br><p>A unique trait of <strong>Plague Goblins</strong> is their ability to consume any form of organic matter. Diets consist of mold, corpses, prepared foods, candies, plant matter, and deceased entities. <strong>Plague Goblins</strong> appear to be immune to psychological anomalies on most levels. This allows them to colonize levels otherwise uninhabitable for humans.</p><br><p><strong>Plague Goblins</strong> are found throughout much of the Backrooms, however, the origins of their discovery are very spotty. The oldest documents possibly describing the entities come from a journal left by an anonymous explorer from 2005 mentioning \"pint-sized plague doctors\" frequently harassing them.</p><br><p>Written by <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/the-dragon-king\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(4285304); return false;\"><img alt=\"The Dragon King\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=4285304&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334064\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=4285304)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/the-dragon-king\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(4285304); return false;\">The Dragon King</a></span></p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/entity-24\">Entity 24</a> | Entity 25 | <a href=\"/entity-26\">Entity 26</a> \u00bb</p><br>",

    "description": "<p>Entity 26, who refers to herself as \u201cSamantha,\u201d is a feline mammal that appears to be a typical domestic house cat, though travelers who have come into contact with her have reported to believe otherwise. The entity is primarily passive, but can quickly turn violent and unpredictable if provoked.</p><br><p>She coaxes travelers into feeding her meat or any meat-based products they may have with them in exchange for a \"psychic reading\" from her using her abilities. The nature of Samantha's psychic readings varies depending on the quality of the meat you provide her with, ranging from extremely detailed and satisfying to exasperatingly negative and vague. Samantha mostly enjoys products like steak, premium fish, and chicken, but seems to have a distaste for low quality meat like spam and sardines.</p><br><p>If not fed anything, even if the traveler is not able to, she will grow extremely violent. Survivors report her attacking like any cat would; scratching, biting, and clawing, although there have been no recorded fatalities involving Samantha.</p><br><p>As well as being capable of speech in at least 3 human languages, Samantha possesses several psychic abilities, including clairvoyance, mind-reading, and teleportation. The full extent of her abilities is currently unknown, and is being researched by M.E.G. Division workers. Samantha is eloquently spoken and shows to have exceptional fluency in her speech when communicating verbally. The M.E.G. is currently debating the idea of using Samantha as a method of managing other entities.</p><br><p>Samantha resembles a domestic house cat with black and white fur and green eyes. Considering the usual size of adult female cats, Samantha is relatively small, leading some to believe she may actually be a kitten or a runt. Samantha has a strong jaw and abnormally serrated teeth, enabling her to tear through skin and meat with ease. Because of this, her bites may result in severe physical trauma.</p><br><p>The first recorded encounter with Samantha was reported to the M.E.G. by an anonymous traveler in July of 2020.

    "description": "<p>Instances of Entity 29 are affectionately known as 'Blub Cats' due to their shape. They resemble round blobs in a variety of shapes, sizes and variants, similar to one of a Felis catus, better known as the domestic household cat. Most Blub Cats portray similar features to each other. Features include, but are not limited to, a round or oval like shape, pointy cat ears, and either big round eyes or closed eyes. No photos of any Blub Cats have been recorded. This is due to the fact that they tend to run away from people with cameras. It seems that Blub Cats are able to sense when they have a camera pointed at them, resulting in the instances in which they have been witnessed to move at extreme speeds.</p><br><p>The behavior mainly depends on the variant of Blub cat, though most of them portray very loving and affectionate behaviors. Despite their lack of need for food and water, they can be fed and tamed by being given any edible substance. Notably, harmful consumables such as <a href=\"/object-48\">Liquid Pain</a> have been proven to have no effect on Blub Cats, as well as possibly being used to tame them.</p><br><p>Blub Cats communicate through varying pitches of squeaks, similar to one of a dog toy. Though, they telepathically communicate words as their direct communication to wanderers. The pitch depends on what the entity is trying to communicate. High pitched squeaks emit from a Blub cat when they are happy, excited, or showing any sort of positive emotion. A medium pitched squeak typically stands for normal communication between Blub Cats and has never been observed to be directed at humans or other entities. Low rumbling is a sound of disapproval, anger, sadness or any other negative emotion.</p><br><p>Blub Cats tend to travel alone or in small packs of 3-5. These are called \u201cGlobs\u201d. Despite their tendency to travel in Globs, it is not uncommon to find Blub Cats traveling in groups of 6+. Larger groups are called \u201cClots\u201d. These should typically be avoided when in small groups, as Blub Cats gain the ability to rob small groups of wanderers of any source of edible substance. However, this tends to be unlikely if the Blub Cats do not contain a ginger variant within the group. Blub Cats tend to travel in clots on levels with survival designations of 4 or 5, will travel in Globs on levels with survival designations of 3 and travel in duos or alone on levels with survival designations of 2 or less.</p><br><p>It has also been observed that Blub Cats tend to get along with other entities, especially Partygoers and Partypoopers. Despite their liking for Partygoers, they will make low rumbling noises when Partygoers come into physical contact with Wanders.</p><br><p>Blub Cats tend to gravitate towards violent individuals or people with anger issues. Due to their lack of ability to feel pain, they encourage people to throw and/or stab them. Blub Cats telepathically communicate this to the said individuals and encourage them to act upon their violent actions. After the individual acts on their violent urges, they are always observed to pick up the closest Blub Cat. They will then no-clip through the ground into a habitable level or any level with a safe survival designation. The individual will then be discovered in a state of slumber approximately 30 minutes later by those who observed them. If the individual was already on a safe level, they will be observed sitting down and falling asleep.</p><br><p>More information about the different breeds\u2019 behaviors can be observed within the \u201cVariants\u201d section.</p><br><p>Blub Cats are feline-like creatures that come in a small variety of breeds. Blub Cats lack all organ groups found within the average cat. Due to this lack of nerves, they are unable to feel pain. Their bodies consist of tanned skin that is covered in an unnatural amount of fur. They are also capable of stretching and flattening their bodies due to their lack of organs.</p><br><p>Blub Cats have whiskers, ears, and tails. Tails can come in a variety of different shapes but tend to be very slim; fluffy tails are more rare amongst Blub Cats. Their ears are identical to ones of a domestic cat, and the same goes for their whiskers.</p><br><p>Blub Cats also have large, circular eyes. Their eyes have large, dilated pupils and a thin iris. These eyes are capable of blinking, along with closing when sleeping. They also have mouths, though these are incapable of opening or changing shape. Due to this, their feeding process just consists of absorbing what they are \u201ceating\u201d.</p><br><p>Baby Blub Cats, or Blubbies, have been observed rolling around <a href=\"/level-11\">Level 11</a>. One wanderer claimed that Blubbies are created by melting off of the \u201cmother\u201d Blub Cat and forming into a ball. The wanderer reported that after 20 seconds, the blobs will then generate large round eyes similar to ones of adult Blub Cats. This has recently been confirmed when the same wanderer brought a Blub Cat which was mid-process of reproducing to M.E.G. base Alpha.</p><br><p>More information about the different breeds\u2019 biology can be observed within the \u201cVariants\u201d section.</p><br><p>Black Blub Cats are the most common amongst Blub Cats, exhibiting the behavior described in the behavior section.<br/>\nThey are most easily tamed with <a href=\"/object-28\">Lucky O\u2019 Milk</a> or <a href=\"/object-1\">Almond Water</a>.</p><br><p>Black Blub Cats tend to be spherical cats with a very dark shade of black fur, though they can be different shapes. Most of these cats are very large, (Equivalent to the size of a half grown Maine coon cat) weighing about 5 lbs or 2.3\u00a0kg.</p><br><p>White Blub Cats appear to be exceedingly rare, but this is merely due to their uncanny ability to hide from wanderers. Other than this, they are practically equivalent to Black Blub Cats.<br/>\nThey are most easily tamed with <a href=\"/object-28\">Lucky O\u2019 Milk</a> or <a href=\"/object-1\">Almond Water</a>.</p><br><p>White Blub Cats tend to be very long, ovoid cats with bright white fur that can glow in the dark or when put under UV lights. Despite their length, most of these cats are equivalent to the width and height of the average domesticated household cat and weigh up to 8 Ibs or 3.7\u00a0kg.</p><br><p>Grey Blub Cats are equally as uncommon as white Blub Cats, but they tend to migrate towards people. They are mostly equivalent to Black Blub Cats but along with being squishy, they can also be thrown, unlike Black and White Blub Cats who will react negatively by scurrying away.<br/>\nThey are most easily tamed with <a href=\"/object-28\">Lucky O\u2019 Milk</a>.</p><br><p>Grey Blub Cats are always spherical cats with a blueish-grey color similar to British short hair, but unlike every other Blub Cat, they usually have folded ears. These ears are identical to the ears of a Scottish fold. They can also have pointed ears, but this is uncommon. They are also equivalent to the size of British shorthairs and Scottish folds and weigh the same as Black Blub Cats.</p><br><p>Brown Blub Cats are the second to rarest breed of Blub cat. They are equivalent to Grey Blub Cats but can be stabbed, as other Blub Cats will retreat from people who try to do such. They also have the lowest squeak amongst Blub Cats.<br/>\nThey are most easily tamed with <a href=\"/object-1\">Almond Water</a> or any sort of food.</p><br><p>Brown Blub Cats tend to come in an egg shape, though they can also be different shapes. Their fur is the color of Hickory brown. They are the size of the average domesticated barn cat and weigh 4 lbs or 1.8\u00a0kg.</p><br><p>Ginger Blub Cats are the most violent of their species, though they can barely harm humans with at most a very small bite. How they bite is still unknown. They can be pacified by being fed food, though this is a bit more difficult than most Blub Cats. They are also the second most common Blub cat and only like being squished, as being thrown or stabbed will enrage them.<br/>\nThey are most easily tamed with any sort of food.</p><br><p>Ginger Cats come in all different types of round shapes, with no common shape. Their fur is identical to an orange Siberian cat, and they also have the fluffiest fur. When unpacified, they exhibit small, furrowed eyebrows. This makes it easy to tell the difference between enraged and pacified ginger Blub Cats. They weigh the same as a black Blub cat and are equivalent in size to a Siberian Cat.</p><br><p>Calico Blub Cats are the least common of their species, despite this, they are the most loveable and cuddly of their species. They are also the hardest to tame, though taming them is worth it as they deter most entities, most easily deterring hounds and death moths.<br/>\nThey are most easily tamed with food or any sort of ball-like toy.</p><br><p>Calico Blub Cats are the largest of their species, equivalent to the size of a full-grown Maine coon cat. They also come in a large variety of shapes and colors, though they tend to be similar in color to the average calico cat with white, brown and orange fur. They are also the heaviest with an average weight of 10 lbs or 4.6\u00a0kg.</p><br><p>~ <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/nocorpseclown\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7979405); return false;\"><img alt=\"NoCorpseClown\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7979405&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334065\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7979405)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/nocorpseclown\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7979405); return false;\">NoCorpseClown</a></span></p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/entity-28\">Entity 28</a> | Entity 29 | <a href=\"/entity-30\">Entity 30</a> \u00bb</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/entity-29\">Entity 29</a>\" by NoCorpseClown, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

He is highly intelligent and literate in many fields, and not confused, bewildered and blind to his own powers.</p><br><p><strong>The King</strong> is the self-proclaimed king of <a href=\"/level-94\">Level 94</a>, with \u201cnone opposing his power\u201d. He sits upon the throne within the Castle of Transparent Mountain, awaiting guests to arrive.</p><br><p>Once guests, in the form of intelligent entities or humans arrive, a long, beautiful dining table, along with two seats will manifest before the victim. The table\u2019s appearance is described as beautiful and ornate, and in no way damaged. <strong>The King</strong> will sit down at one of the seats, and will ask the victim to sit down at the other end. There is no way to refuse this offer.</p><br><p><strong>The King</strong> will begin to talk of wonderful things. He will speak of ways out of the Level, and out of the infinite maze that his guest is trapped in, and to trust in him to set him free.</p><br><p>To trust in <strong>The King</strong> is wise, as he has done no wrong to his people, and to those he has freed, although why you would want to be set free at all from his wondrous kingdom is beyond me.

If you do refuse, terrible things might happen to you, although this is highly unlikely. <strong>The King</strong> will let you go, but he will be very frustrated at doing so.

    "description": "<p>Entity 34, instances of which are known as \"Dollface\" by wanderers, are small doll-like (similar to a Raggedy Ann doll) humanoid Entities that can be found in the Backrooms. While their physical body appears to be a cloth or wool plushie, their physiology is much more similar to that of an <a href=\"/entity-32\">Animation</a> from <a href=\"/level-94\">Level 94</a>. They are self-replicating, and extremely hostile unless tamed. Tamed instances of Entity 34 are often picked up as companions by wanderers, considering them to be \"cute\".</p><br><p>Singular instances will roam a certain Level, or her immediate surroundings until it spots another Entity or wanderer. This is more often than not a <a href=\"/entity-8\">Hound</a> or <a href=\"/entity-4\">a Deathmoth</a>. They will slowly approach, and say something along the lines of \"Hi! I'm Dollface, it's nice to meet you!\". Soon after, it may attack, or just stand there, but usually it will just run away. If there is a group accompanying it, the rest will attack at this time.</p><br><p>Fortunately, dealing with a Dollface is as easy as taming one, just offer them <a href=\"/object-1\">Almond Water</a> and act friendly to them. After this, the Dollface will act kindly to you and follow you around. It is not possible to tame one if it is part of a large group. Quickly replicating groups of Entity 34 have been known to completely dismantle communities in the past, but responding quickly enough to the situation will render them just minor pests.</p><br><p>Entity 34 is believed to be either partially, or a variant of, Animations, based on interview logs (see below) and their internal organ systems. During a vivisection of one that was found in <a href=\"/level-20\">Level 20</a>, it was discovered that while lacking organic material and bio-fluids, instances of Entity 34 all contain some sort of functional organ system. Eating, drinking, and even sleeping, are possible and seemingly needed in order for them to survive (though this has not been confirmed).</p><br><p>Usually, Dollface is about 2-3 feet tall, and is very light in weight. The hair is typically made of yarn or horsehair, eyes are sewn on buttons, and the mouth is sewn on with yarn or pipe cleaner. The \"skin\" color is usually brown or dark blonde, their bodies made of fabric and cloth. The ends of their hands are decorated with shards of broken buttons. Offspring created by Dollface exhibit identical characteristics as the original, meaning they reproduce asexually. How this happens is still unclear.</p><br><p>Hallucinations, whether induced by stress, the backrooms themselves, or other factors, often cause wanderers to see strange things, and killer children's dolls have never been rare sightings for those in unstable states. However, these early sightings may or may not be Dollface. The earliest confirmed instance of Dollface took place in 1958.</p><br><p>The following is an attempt at an interview with Entity 34, in order to further understand their behavior when in a passive state.</p><br><p><strong>Begin Log:</strong> 03:02<br/>\n<strong>Interviewer:</strong> M.E.G. Researcher Kim-Lee<br/>\n<strong>Interviewee:</strong> Entity 34 - \"Dollface\"</p><br><p><em>Kim drops a few drops of almond water onto the mouth stick on Entity 34's face. The doll starts convulsing, and eventually sits up on its own.</em></p><br><p><strong>Entity 34:</strong> \"Hi! I'm Dollface, how are you doing today?\"</p><br><p><strong>Researcher Kim:</strong> \"Hello Dollface, I am Researcher Kim-Lee. Would\u2026 it be alright if I asked you some questions?</p><br><p><strong>Entity 34:</strong> \"Okay!\"</p><br><p><strong>Researcher Kim:</strong> \"Good.\"</p><br><p><strong>Entity 34:</strong> \"I was created by <a href=\"/entity-33\">our glorious King</a>! He had gifted me life and friendship outside of his kingdom! Isn't he great?!</p><br><p><strong>Researcher Kim:</strong> \"It doesn't really seem like friendship to me. Why do you like to hurt people?\"</p><br><p><strong>Entity 34:</strong> \"Hurting people? I would never! Though, sometimes I wake up and see red stuff on my hands after I wake up\u2026 Does that count?</p><br><p><strong>Researcher Kim:</strong> Nevermind. Now, what can you tell me about- Dollface? Is everything alright?</p><br><p><strong>Entity 34:</strong> \"AAAAAAAAAGHHH!\"</p><br><p><strong>Researcher Kim:</strong> What are you-</p><br><p><em>Entity 34 begins convulsing violently, as its body begins to tear in half from the stomach. Another doll crawls out.</em></p><br><p><strong>Researcher Kim:</strong> Wh-what the fuck!?</p><br><p><strong>Entity 34 (2):</strong> \"Hi! I'm Dollface, how are you doing today?\"</p><br><p><strong>Summary:</strong> Both dolls were immediately disposed of, and Researcher Kim-Lee was escorted to safety.<br/>\n<strong>End Log:</strong> 03:10</p><br><p>Rewritten by <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/1000dumplings\">1000dumplings</a><br/>\nArt of Entity 34 created by @GarbDemon#6933</p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/entity-33\">Entity 33</a> | Entity 34 | <a href=\"/entity-35\">Entity 35</a> \u00bb</p><br>",

    "description": "<p>Light Guides are infinitely small points that radiate light, forming an orb-like appearance, similar to a singularity. They are quite rare to come across, but when found, can lead wanderers towards supplies and help them avoid dangerous entities. They can move freely, being able to change direction at will, and are also able to phase through walls. They appear and disappear at random intervals, but can seemingly control when this occurs.</p><br><p>Light Guides are docile entities and no signs of hostility have ever been documented. They have rudimentary communication, being able to move around in a dance-like fashion and changing colors. When two or more entities come across each other, they will all work together in aiding a wanderer. They commonly lead wanderers to sources of <a href=\"/object-1\">Almond Water</a> and other vital supplies. They seemingly have awareness of the location of other entities, and aid in helping travelers avoid them. They appear to have knowledge and sight of things beyond human comprehension due to their nigh-omniscient knowledge of the level they are currently in.</p><br><p>Light Guides are infinitely small singularities of pure light, apparently spherical, ranging in size between 5-15 centimeters. It is impossible to kill a Light Guide, as they can phase through any and all objects.</p><br><p>Light Guides have been reported to exist as long as the Backrooms themselves. The first encounter with this entity was in <a href=\"/level-4\">Level 4</a>, with it leading a group of travelers to a crate of supplies. They are found in most levels but are most commonly found in <a href=\"/level-263\">Level -0</a>, <a href=\"/level-4\">Level 4</a>, and <a href=\"/level-6\">Level 6</a>.</p><br><p>What was that thing? These <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">fairy</span> glowy things, orbs of some kind showed up out of nowhere.

I asked the other survivors if they have seen anything like this and told me I was hallucinating. I <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">saw</span>, no, I KNOW these things are real.

    "title": "- \"Cannibal Cuisines\"",
    "description": "<p><strong>Entity 36</strong>, more colloquially known as \"<strong>Cannibal Cuisine</strong>\", refers to an anomalous type of vending machine found within the Backrooms.</p><br><p><strong>Cannibal Cuisines</strong> are about 6 feet tall, 4 feet wide, and 2.5 feet deep. Oftentimes, they adopt the look of various different Frontrooms brands. On the back of <strong>Entity 36</strong>, a tag can be found reading the following:</p><br><p>Cannibal Cuisine Productions<br/>\nIris Family<br/>\n<em>\"From humans, by humans, for humans.\"</em><br/>\n2019, Arizona</p><br><p>As of now, no information is currently available about the Iris family or their goals, origins, and whether they actually exist within the Backrooms or not.</p><br><p><strong>Cannibal Cuisines</strong> have shown to be extremely durable, capable of withstanding attacks from most weapons with the exception of <a href=\"/object-42\">Bottled Lightning</a>, which has appeared to moderately damage instances of <strong>Entity 36</strong>.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> The cause behind the entity's resistance to most methods of assault, and weakness towards electricity, is unknown and currently being researched.</p><br><p>At first glance, <strong>Entity 36</strong> appears to be functionally identical to a modern vending machine with a few key differences.</p><br><p>Firstly, <strong>Cannibal Cuisines</strong> don't require any amount of payment to operate it. Each \u201cproduct\u201d within the entity is tied to a pair of one letter and number. There are two keypads on the machine, one containing a set of numbers, and the other, letters\u2014once one of each is selected, a product with the corresponding pair will be released. To continue, instead of using rotating metal coils to release products, the machine uses a severed, skeletal human hand, which pushes products to the front until one falls and is ready to be obtained by the user.</p><br><p>All products from <strong>Entity 36</strong> are made of a variety of human parts, including but not limited to:</p><br><p>The various products that <strong>Cannibal Cuisines</strong> can contain are generated seemingly at random. Some items may generate with plenty in stock, while others will only have one to two instances. The latter usually refers to products using organs vital to human survival such as the heart and lungs. Records of encounters with the entity have noted the following items, including but not limited to:</p><br><p>Every 12 hours, the products within a <strong>Cannibal Cuisine</strong> will all be instantaneously replenished, appearing out of thin air. Products that have not been taken will simply remain inside.</p><br><p>All items produced by <strong>Entity 36</strong> contain an extremely high amount of dopamine that, when consuming any amount, can cause an inexplicable addiction for them. Addicted individuals devote themselves to obtaining as much food as they can from the <strong>Cannibal Cuisine</strong> and are willing to risk their lives to do so. Wanderers affected by this addiction will often attempt to stay near the area wherein which they initially found the <strong>Cannibal Cuisine</strong>, to the point of refusing access to other levels\u2014even if the level in question was safer. Multiple wanderers that are victim to the same instance of <strong>Entity 36</strong> may also attempt to harm one another to ensure more food for themselves.</p><br><p>Normal side-effects of high amounts of dopamine include euphoria, binge eating, addiction, poor impulse control, and heightened aggressiveness. Besides generally inciting an extreme feeling of joy, products from <strong>Cannibal Cuisines</strong> also cause a few other effects, such as:</p><br><p>Afflicted individuals have claimed to hear voices emanating from <strong>Cannibal Cuisines</strong>, which become more prevalent during the machine\u2019s replenishment and the consumption of a product. These voices are often described as either \u201cblood-curdling screams,\u201d \u201ccries of agony,\u201d and/or \u201csoft yet discomforting sobs\u201d. Most victims recall that these voices manifest in the form of a loved one from their past before entering the Backrooms.</p><br><p>Many victims of <strong>Cannibal Cuisines</strong> have attempted to quit the use of their products, but this is extremely difficult due to aforementioned effects. All recorded attempts to quit the products have failed due to starvation or lack of will to continue.</p><br><p><strong>Entity 36</strong> sightings go as far back as March of 2020. However, the first time the M.E.G officially documented them was in August, when a group of <strong>Entity 36</strong> victims was observed and reported by a wanderer traveling through <a href=\"/level-13\">Level 13</a>. Upon verification of the victims' identities and their testimonies, the source of their dilemma was found to be a nearby vending machine, where one observer made the mistake of eating a product from a <strong>Cannibal Cuisine</strong> and subsequently becoming afflicted with its effects. It was then that the entity was documented and classified.</p><br><p><strong>Notice: Revision released one (1) second ago.</strong><br/>\n<span style=\"color:green\">View new revision?</span></p><br><p>Notice: The following information has only recently been discovered, and some of it is nothing but theory crafting. As such, all new info has been put into a completely separate section of the document. An effort is currently being made to fully revise the document.</p><br><p>On September 29th, 2020, a <strong>Cannibal Cuisine</strong> assaulted a group of 7 wanderers, The group reported that the entity attacked when one member of the group hit it with a recently obtained crowbar for self-defense practice. The entity reportedly protruded large, skeletal arms from a compartment on the top of its body and used it to slash at the wanderers. It eventually ceased function after all 7 wanderers attacked it with various items, including Bottles of Lightning. The assault ended overall with only one casualty on the group's side. Said survivors were compensated for their work.<br/>\nDismantling the machine showed a storage area found in the back, which contained three abnormal human corpses, all in various levels of decay. These corpses were found to use their vocal cords to create quiet sounds akin to whispering. All attempts to decipher the whispering failed. All three bodies had their arms detached and laid on the floor. A note was also found taped to the head of one of the bodies, reading the following:</p><br><p>Henry Iris<br/>\nSteven Iris<br/>\nMarvin Iris</p><br><p><br/>\nOne popular theory formed from this discovery was that the voices <strong>Entity 36</strong> victims hear are produced by the corpses within the entity. On November 3rd, 2020, M.E.G researcher Alan Smith paired with a group of armed M.E.G agents engaged a recently-reported <strong>Cannibal Cuisine</strong> on <a href=\"/level-1\">Level 1</a>. The entity was incapacitated with Bottled Lightning without fully killing it.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup> The instance was then dismantled, revealing the storage area. Notably, the storage area contained another 3 corpses with 3 different first names then the previous 3. A nearby victim of Entity 36 claimed to hear screams while at the same time, a head inside the machine was seen with its jaw agape, as if it was screaming.</p><br><p>Food items from the entity were carefully collected and tested for human DNA within Base Omega. All equipment used in the testing subsequently broke down, becoming unusable.</p><br><p>On November 24th, 2020, a pair of wanderers encountered a <strong>Cannibal Cuisine</strong>. A third individual independent from the two had already succumbed to the entity's products and suffered the baseline effects. The victim expressed heavy emotional distress, claiming that he had been consuming flesh belonging to his sister and had been hearing her shriek into his ear. One person from the pair, having heard of the entity from a M.E.G researcher, attempted to explain how the <strong>Cannibal Cuisine</strong> functioned, and how the screams were fabricated. Within 10 seconds, the entity produced skeletal arms from its bottom, using them as legs to pursue the wanderer. Unable to escape, the wanderer was subsequently clawed to death.</p><br><p>The second wanderer was able to flee the scene and contact M.E.G. agents about the encounter. The corpse was eventually found nearby. The third individual was waiting for a restock of <strong>Entity 36's</strong> products, oblivious to the presence of the body.</p><br><p>Each <strong>Cannibal Cuisine</strong> contains three armless humanoid cadavers within its storage area. Based on abnormal differences from human bodies such as shorter legs, a lack of foot phalanges, and larger jaws, considering these bodies human is, at best, questionable. Each one of them is given a name via a written index card taped to one of the bodies. All bodies seem to be given the last name, \"Iris\", with the first name varying on a case-by-case basis. The heads of each body are capable of opening their jaws to create sounds akin to whispering. Victims of <strong>Entity 36</strong> instead percept these noises as the panicking screaming of a victim's close family member or friend.</p><br><p>A <strong>Cannibal Cuisine</strong> has two trap doors; one found on the top of its body and the other on the bottom. These trapdoors can be opened seemingly at will by <strong>Entity 36</strong>. When opened, elongated skeleton arms will appear from inside the contraption, acting as feet if coming from the bottom trapdoor. The arms have measured up to 54 inches long and are coated in an unidentified metallic material.</p><br><p><strong>Entity 36</strong> appears to have full control over the arms and will mostly use them as a form of transportation and to attack wanderers by swiping at them. The entity can be provoked by one attempting to inflict physical harm on the entity or its victims.</p><br><p>This hostility can also be triggered if one attempts to explain a <strong>Cannibal Cuisine's</strong> anomalous effects to an afflicted wanderer, more specifically; the way the corpses within the entity create screaming noises.</p><br><p>When provoked in the latter method, <strong>Entity 36</strong> displays much more hostility, agility, and strength. Either way, victims do not perceive the entity\u2019s movement nor any casualties it causes, reportedly observing the vending machine staying in one place. The entity will attack the offender until said offender either gets an unmeasured distance away from the victim<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')\">3</a></sup>, or is killed, by the <strong>Cannibal Cuisine</strong> or other means.

    "description": "<p>The <strong>Curabitur Birds</strong> are relatively large avians which prey on male Deathmoths using a long sticky tongue to attract and trap them. They are mostly harmless when it comes to interactions with humans, as they will flee if they notice any creature larger than themselves approach. They are extremely slow, only able to locomote by flapping their nearly vestigial wings.</p><br><p>The <strong>Curabitur Bird</strong> is almost always in a nearly completely dormant state. They can spend days at a time floating in a single spot, only snapping into action when a perceived threat draws too close or when a male Deathmoth comes into contact with their tongue. The Deathmoth is attracted to the bioluminescent tip of the <strong>Curabitur Bird's</strong> tongue, and will get stuck in the highly adhesive saliva that coats it. <strong>Curabitur Birds</strong> are unable to consume female Deathmoths and will avoid areas where they are present.</p><br><p><strong>Curabitur Birds</strong> pose no threat to humans in almost any situation. They flee from humans, so even though they do have a sharp talon at the end of each of their legs they aren't likely to use them. The only time that a <strong>Curabitur Bird</strong> attacks a human is when it is trapped by one, which typically happens when they are being hunted. This is not a problem when they are attacked at range.</p><br><p>Much of the biological information on the Curabitur Bird has been provided on behalf of Dr. Trescothick of the Backrooms Research Consortium.</p><br><p>Perhaps the most striking feature of the Curabitur Bird is the bioluminescent gel which it stores in the hump on its back. Despite the fact that this gel is a semisolid, it is significantly lighter than air, allowing this strange creature to stay airborne almost indefinitely.<br/>\nThis substance, which I will henceforth refer to as Curabitur Gel for simplicity's sake, has an incredible potential for practical uses. When extracted from the Curabitur Bird, the gel will maintain its light giving properties for up to several days. This window of usefulness can be extended almost indefinitely when the gel is exposed to a significant amount of heat. This means that a jar of Curabitur Gel could serve as a constant light source in warmer levels of the Backrooms.<br/>\nAt the moment me and my colleagues are attempting to find other practical applications for the Curabitur Gel. We believe that the properties that allow it to float on air could be incredibly useful in a wide swath of technologies. I have personally ruled out the possibility for its use as a foodstuff, as the gel has an incredibly acrid flavour and is much too acidic to safely swallow.</p><br><p>Curabitur Birds were discovered alongside Level 45, and have since dispersed to many levels in which they find the habitat suitable.</p><br><p>[info on the production of the article and/or the authors behind it]<br/>\n~ <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pokkin\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7284643); return false;\"><img alt=\"Pokkin\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7284643&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1731114327\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7284643)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pokkin\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7284643); return false;\">Pokkin</a></span></p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/entity-36\">Entity 36</a> | Entity 37 | <a href=\"/entity-38\">Entity 38</a> \u00bb</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/entity-37\">Entity 37 - \"Curabitur Bird\"</a>\" by Pokkin, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

    "description": "<p>Entity 38, commonly referred to as Humanoids, are enigmatic yet ironically social Humanoid entities that bear a striking resemblance to humans in various aspects. However, the majority of their physical attributes remain concealed in darkness, as they possess pitch-black skin. Remarkably, these entities invariably exhibit either male or female characteristics. Extensive experimentation conducted by the <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-m-e-g\">M.E.G.</a> has determined that the biological gender of a Humanoid can solely be identified through vocal characteristics, height, and bone structure, as they lack any distinguishing features. It is important to note that Humanoids are not genetically related to humans despite their uncanny similarities.</p><br><p>Despite their sociable nature and prevalent presence within the Backrooms, Humanoids remain one of the least explored and most mysterious entities. The multitude of unique variations among them conceals separate enigmas, making it unlikely that we will ever fully unveil the secrets surrounding these entities.</p><br><p>The majority of Humanoid variants display humanitarian tendencies and possess sentience. They exhibit no signs of aggression unless provoked. However, it is essential to acknowledge that not all variants are inherently hospitable. Humanoids demonstrate exceptional proficiency with ranged weapons and possess remarkable combat skills. The precise reason behind their aptitude in combat remains unconfirmed, although researchers speculate that genetic mutations and natural selection in their hostile environment have contributed to this distinct capability. Humanoids harbor an aversion to hostile entities such as <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-9\">Facelings</a> and <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-10\">Skin Stealers</a>, often engaging in recreational killing of these entities.</p><br><p>It is noteworthy that Humanoids universally communicate fluently in English, utilizing various accents ranging from Western to South Asian. The means by which Humanoids acquire fluency in English without external influence is currently undergoing examination but is likely to remain unresolved. In exceptionally rare cases, Humanoids communicate in an unidentified language that remains indecipherable to this day.</p><br><p>Importantly, multiple voice recordings have been retrieved from interactions with these anomalous beings.</p><br><p>Male 1: Alright, got the tape goin'?</p><br><p>Male 2: Yep.</p><br><p>Male 1: Great.</p><br><p>(Silence)</p><br><p>Male 1: Hand me the mic.</p><br><p>Male 1: Alright, I don't know if this recording will make it to the M.E.G., but I sure hope it does.</p><br><p>Male 2: You gonna get to the point or not?</p><br><p>Male 1: Wait a goddamn moment.</p><br><p>(Brushing noises, presumably from movement of microphone.)</p><br><p>Male 1: Alright, so about a week ago we met a Humanoid that speaks a\u2026 questionable language.</p><br><p>Male 1: I've never encountered a Humanoid that spoke anything other than english.</p><br><p>Male 1: On top of that, it looks exactly the same as a normal one.</p><br><p>(Indistinct murmuring of another individual.)</p><br><p>Male 2: I'll finish the statement, hand the microphone over.</p><br><p>(Noise)</p><br><p>Male 2: As we currently don't have a camera, the best thing I can do for you is describe the entity.</p><br><p>Male 2: As far as we can see, this guy seems no different from a normal variant.</p><br><p>Male 2: Let me try to talk to him.</p><br><p>(Rustling of microphone)</p><br><p>Humanoid: \u2026</p><br><p>Male 2: It's okay, you can speak.</p><br><p>Humanoid: N smjjeh pjdlgihmjd rmh oep mgl imonjv,</p><br><p>Male 2: Do you understand English?</p><br><p>Humanoid: Rlgl ma n?</p><br><p>Humanoid: N zllb bncl n ma zmg zgea real.</p><br><p>(Sounds of heavy breathing can be heard as Male 2 can be heard trying to calm the Humanoid down.)</p><br><p>Male 2: Woah buddy, we're not gonna hurt you, please calm down.</p><br><p>Male 1: What's wrong with him?</p><br><p>Humanoid: N jlld he ve fmsc real! n jlld he mgj hrla! n smj'h blh rna hmcl hrla!</p><br><p>Male 2: Huh?</p><br><p>Male 1: CALM DOWN!</p><br><p>(Louding banging can be heard.)</p><br><p>Male 2: Oh my god\u2026</p><br><p>Male 1: What the hell!?</p><br><p>(Humanoid can no longer be heard.)</p><br><p>Male 2: He just threw himself into the wall\u2026</p><br><p>Male 1: Is he.. dead?</p><br><p>Male 2: I think so. Look at all that blood\u2026</p><br><p>Male 1: Holy shit\u2026</p><br><p>Male 1: What do we do? Should we end the recording?</p><br><p>Male 2: I guess so, but I have a few more things to say. Hold on</p><br><p>Male 2: I do not know what that Humanoid was saying, but I suspect it to be a warning of some kind.</p><br><p>Male 2: By the time you find this tape, I'm not sure if we'll still be around.</p><br><p>(Echoing groan can be heard, cutting off whatever Male 2 was about to say.)</p><br><p>Male 1: Uh, you hear that?</p><br><p>(Clip cuts shortly after a loud crash is heard.)</p><br><p>Due to safety concerns, the original location of the tape has been classified and undisclosed. The two unidentified males mentioned in the recording remain unaccounted for, with their whereabouts still unknown to this day. Thorough investigation into this event is currently underway, and preliminary evidence indicates the possibility of a specific variant of Humanoids being subjected to a secondary influence from an unidentified source.</p><br><p>Female: What the hell is that?</p><br><p>(Indistinct murmuring of incoherent speech is heard)</p><br><p>Female: I was walking through a dark area and now I hear this shit.</p><br><p>(Murmuring grows louder)</p><br><p>Female: Shit, shit, shit! It's getting closer.</p><br><p>Female: \u2026</p><br><p>Female: It's a\u2026 Humanoid\u2026?</p><br><p>Humanoid: Rlgl ma n?

Why did he kill himself?</p><br><p>The remaining portion of the voice tape is severely damaged, rendering it mangled and torn. Alongside the fragmented recording, an anomalous Humanoid was discovered deceased in close proximity to a wall at the location of its discovery. The autopsy conducted on the Humanoid revealed evidence of blunt force trauma to the frontal skull, suggesting a probable case of suicide. Regrettably, the fate of the unidentified female mentioned in the voice tape remains unknown.</p><br><p>Based on the collective records of interactions with non-English-speaking Humanoids, there appears to be a disquieting connection between the disappearance of individuals who have engaged with these unique Humanoid variants. Some researchers have become convinced that an unknown external force is interfering with these interactions, although the debate surrounding this theory remains ongoing. Compounding the suspicion is the fact that all encounters with such Humanoids have culminated in the Humanoids carrying out a brutal and seemingly desperate form of self-inflicted demise. These observations provide further fuel for speculation and investigation into the underlying factors at play.</p><br><p>The precise origin of Humanoids remains undisclosed, shrouded in mystery within the realm of the Backrooms. These entities are frequently observed throughout various sectors of the Backrooms, with a notable presence in relatively safer levels, notably <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-1\">Level 1</a> and <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-4\">Level 4</a>. Humanoids possess the capacity to manifest across an extensive array of levels within the Backrooms. However, it is worth noting that in exceedingly perilous environments, Humanoids are conspicuously absent, their presence being untenable due to the formidable threats posed by resident entities.</p><br><p>Humanoids exhibit an amiable disposition towards humans, often utilizing the term \"Brothers\" to address them. It is crucial to exercise caution and refrain from inciting these entities, as any form of provocation is likely to elicit a defensive response. Humanoids typically possess physical capabilities comparable to that of an average human and demonstrate a heightened level of intelligence.</p><br><p>The entities referred to as Humanoids exhibit distinct anatomical characteristics that deviate significantly from those of the average human. Notably, they lack internal organs, aside from a bluish brain-like organ situated within their head, as evidenced through autopsy findings. Analysis of their internal composition reveals the presence of red fluids abundant in iron, surpassing the iron content observed in standard human blood, and containing traces of copper. Their skin possesses a light-absorbing property, rendering it visually indistinguishable and presenting a deep black appearance, albeit discernible through tactile means. The surface of a Humanoid's skin exhibits a coarse texture, and their bodily composition contains a lower proportion of water compared to humans. While water remains essential to both Humanoids and wanderers, Humanoids exhibit a decreased water requirement for survival in comparison to humans.</p><br><p>The dental structure of Humanoids is composed of a similar material to that found in human teeth. Notably, Humanoid minors do not undergo tooth loss. The genetic makeup of Humanoids displays exponential mutation rates, leading to the rapid emergence of new variants. However, it is noteworthy that Humanoids lack the capacity to develop immunity to <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-19\">The Disease</a> due to limitations within their immune system's adaptive capabilities.</p><br><p>Variants are classified by the color of their facial features.</p><br><p>White-faced Humanoids represent the most prevalent variant among Humanoids encountered within the Backrooms environment. Their frequency is notably high across <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-1\">Level 1</a> through <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-5\">Level 5.</a>Despite their physical characteristics being confined to a uniform white expression, these variants exhibit human-like functionalities. Notably, white-faced Humanoids serve as the quintessential embodiment of the Humanoid entity and are hypothesized to not be the very first, but one of the original ancestors of multiple common variants</p><br><p>Red-faced Humanoids exhibit a notable lack of communication with both humans and other entities, including fellow Humanoids. They primarily inhabit sublevels or areas characterized by a high presence of entities. These variants have undergone adaptations to mitigate the inherent dangers of their environments and possess the capacity to guide lost individuals to safety. red-faced Humanoids demonstrate exceptional physical strength, surpassing that of an average human by tenfold. Furthermore, they possess a remarkable ability to perceive their surroundings without any reliance on external illumination. Current consensus holds that these entities are a direct evolutionary offshoot of white-faced Humanoids, prompted by an unidentified catalyst prompting migration and subsequent transformation. Regrettably, limited information exists regarding these variants, as establishing communication with them proves exceedingly challenging.</p><br><p>Yellow-faced Humanoids represent an exceptionally scarce presence within the primary levels, yet they stand out as one of the most resolute variants among Humanoids. Notably, they display a remarkable ability to effectively disregard the influence exerted by <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-134\">Phobic Centipede</a>. Additionally, they have demonstrated survivability in the face of prolonged exposure to the mind-controlling capabilities of the <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-30\">Mother</a> within Level 1.5. The evolutionary factors contributing to the development of this variant to its current state have encompassed encounters with metaphysical entities and exposure to mind-altering environments that may have been inhabited in the past. Notably, the acquisition of this ability from Yellow-faced Humanoids themselves remains unattainable. These variants are exceedingly rare and exhibit an antisocial disposition, resulting in limited available information and an absence of documented records pertaining to verbal interactions. The aforementioned insights have been derived from meticulous long-range observations, as Yellow-faced Humanoids promptly evade human presence upon detection.</p><br><p>Limited knowledge is available regarding blue-faced Humanoids, as their dwindling population currently inhabits <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-6\">Level 6</a>. Communication by blue Humanoids occurs in English, albeit at ultralow frequencies, perceptible to humans solely as low-pitched static. These variants typically exhibit a propensity for frowning, with an anomalous behavior of displaying smiles in response to contracting any form of illness. It is noteworthy that blue-faced Humanoids are twice as susceptible to diseases compared to typical Humanoids. Morphologically, they often manifest as tall and lanky entities, attaining heights reaching up to 10 feet. Despite their imposing physical appearance, documented evidence has revealed no instances of aggressive behavior displayed by this variant of Humanoid.</p><br><p>The reasons underlying the strikingly minimal population of blue-faced Humanoids remain elusive, resisting comprehensive resolution. These variants tend to avoid contact with humans, although interaction may be feasible if consumables are offered to them. While the genetic lineage of blue-faced Humanoids remains uncertain, prevailing theories suggest their potential descent from red-faced Humanoids following an unexplained transition across levels. Researchers have drawn attention to the unsettling resemblance between these variants and the deceased entity known as the late <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-68\">partypoopers</a>. However, thorough investigations have confirmed the absence of any genetic connection between these entities, implying independent evolutionary paths leading to their shared resemblance. The origins and mechanisms driving this convergence continue to elude scientific comprehension, fostering an eerie air of intrigue and enigma surrounding blue-faced Humanoids.</p><br><p>Green-faced Humanoids are exceptional and infrequently encountered variations among Humanoids, possessing the unique capability of traversing between the realm of virtuality and physical reality. Physically, they assume the appearance of a standard Humanoid, with the exception of their green face. yet they possess the ability to render themselves imperceptible while existing within their digital manifestation. These entities exhibit a marked preference for inhabiting electronic devices rather than maintaining a physical presence, potentially driven by a self-preservational instinct.</p><br><p>Remarkably, green-faced Humanoids possess the uncanny capacity to effortlessly circumvent firewalls and digital security barriers, granting them unrestricted access to classified digital documents and confidential information. Over time and through gradual social interactions, these variants can develop amicable associations with individuals, thereby facilitating the exchange of vital information.</p><br><p>However, the population of green-faced Humanoids has experienced a steady decline due to the rise of digital entities. As a consequence, their presence has become increasingly scarce and enigmatic, heightening the sense of unease surrounding their existence.</p><br><p>Turquoise-faced Humanoids, characterized by their tall and slender physique, represent a notable Humanoid variant renowned for their exceptional physical strength, thus earning them the informal moniker of \"Steroid Humanoids.\" In contrast to the sedentary nature of red-faced Humanoids, these individuals are nomadic in nature, perpetually traversing the vast expanse of the Backrooms. Notably sociable, turquoise-faced Humanoids actively engage in reconnaissance and delivery tasks, offering assistance to organizations such as the M.E.G and <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/b-n-t-g\">B.N.T.G.</a></p><br><p>Based on observations, it is plausible to surmise that turquoise-faced Humanoids trace their lineage back to red-faced variants, as their formidable strength bears resemblance to that of their presumed progenitors.</p><br><p>Subsequent to a pivotal incident, the fundamental nature of these variants underwent an astonishing transformation, rendering their behaviors and capabilities unrecognizable. In response, concerted relocation efforts were initiated, effectively isolating these enigmatic entities in an undisclosed location. Despite persistent endeavors, the legendary variants in question have eluded discovery, shrouded in an impenetrable veil of secrecy.</p><br><p>Following extensive debates, all documentation pertaining to vital information regarding these variants was systematically eradicated or rendered classified, thereby depriving us of any authoritative knowledge concerning their distinctive attributes. What remains unequivocal is the irreversible alteration that transpired, whereby these entities ceased to embody the essence of typical Humanoids, metamorphosing into an altogether different malevolent entity.</p><br><p>The incident itself, a chronicle cloaked in ambiguity, unfolded as a series of events orchestrated by an unidentified collective. This shadowy assembly subjected the variants to an unknown object or entity, precipitating their alarming transformation. Notably, the specifics regarding the nature and origin of this object or entity remain largely veiled in obscurity, contributing to the enigmatic aura surrounding the incident.</p><br><p>Gray-faced Humanoids exhibit a biology identical to that of white-faced Humanoids. However, these particular variants display a distinct set of characteristics, characterized by their aggressive and carnivorous nature, as well as their heightened intelligence compared to standard entities found within the Backrooms. The similarities shared between gray-faced and white-faced Humanoids can often lead to fatal consequences, as the former demonstrates an immediate and relentless propensity to attack upon visual detection. Notably, gray-faced Humanoids possess a physical structure indistinguishable from that of a normal Humanoid.</p><br><p>The static-faced Humanoid exhibits a slightly tall stature and a commanding presence with notable broad shoulders. Their facial expression remains fixed in a perpetual smile, even during verbal communication, while the static patterns adorning their faces remain unchanging and impervious to external factors. These enigmatic variants display significant divergence both mentally and physically from other known Humanoid variations. While fluent in the English language, static-faced Humanoids employ an archaic form of English dialect reminiscent of the linguistic style employed during the era of Shakespeare. This linguistic peculiarity may potentially correlate with their extensive biological age, as discerned through analysis of bodily fluids. The average lifespan of a static-faced Humanoid varies greatly, but is estimated to be aorund 400,000 to 700,000 years. Raising conjecture regarding the existence of distinct ancient Humanoid dialects or possibly an entirely different language altogether. However, concrete evidentiary support for such claims remains absent, given that static-faced Humanoids represent the sole known long-lived variant. Due to absent comparative data from another long-lived Humanoid variant, the true nature of this linguistic phenomenon may remain elusive. Notably, static-faced Humanoids demonstrate a heightened level of sagacity and intelligence, surpassing even that of the partygoers. Despite their imposing appearance, static-faced Humanoids do not display any hostile tendencies. Owing to their elusive nature and declining population, locating these Humanoid variants poses a considerable challenge. Nonetheless, several static-faced Humanoids have been apprehended and subjected to interrogation in order to glean information on their whereabouts. A particular individual of interest is a variant identifying himself as \"Arthur\" and boasting a remarkable age of 913,549 years. The insights shared by Arthur during these interrogations have elicited concerns among researchers, prompting further scrutiny and introspection into established knowledge. The ensuing section features documented voicelogs obtained from these interrogations.</p><br><p>Overseer 1: Alright, we got the video rolling.</p><br><p>Overseer 2: Good.

Though mine memory may be shrouded in clouds, I dost recollect being brought forth into this world within a humble shack, guided by my mother.</p><br><p>Overseer 2: Uh\u2026 alright.</p><br><p>(Overseer 2 can be heard writing things on paper)</p><br><p>Overseer 2: Do you remember anything strange regarding your childhood?</p><br><p>(A moment of silence occurs as you can hear Alice breathing)</p><br><p>(Alice's voice lowers to a whisper)</p><br><p>Alice: I am uncertain if I may utter these words aloud.</p><br><p>Overseer 2: Please do, Alice.</p><br><p>(Alice sighs)</p><br><p>Alice: In my youthful days, I doth recall a troupe of kin akin to mine own. We, as children, were tethered close, restricted by a wall, erecteds by village elders. I, a tender lass at that time, bear in mind the ill-advised misstep of my elder brother, who disregarded parental caution with dire consequences.</p><br><p>Overseer 2: Ah, what happened to your elder brother?</p><br><p>Alice: Once he traversed the wall, I did tarry long, awaiting his homecoming in vain. Alas, he never returned to my side. We were unable to dispatch any soul beyond the wall, forsooth, as entry into its dominion was deemed impossible. Whatever dwelt yonder forbade our passage, denying us access to its abode.</p><br><p>Overseer 2: Do you recall any instance or identity of the force that was keeping everybody within the walls?</p><br><p>(Alice fidgets for a moment before answering)</p><br><p>Alice: We, as youthful brood, remained ignorant of what lay beyond. Our elders spun tales of an endless maze, wherein any who dared venture were met with a dire curse. A labyrinth boundless and treacherous, governed by a being who ensnared wanderers in perpetual captivity, forever trapping those who dared enter his realm.</p><br><p>Overseer 2: Your elders, they told you about a being?</p><br><p>Alice: Verily, they did regale us with such tales, aiming to dissuade our wanderlust. Yet, in my tender years, I harbored doubts and scarce did I truly embrace the narratives spun.</p><br><p>(Alice sighs, a bit louder this time)</p><br><p>Alice: Well, I clung to that belief, until\u2026</p><br><p>Overseer 2: Until what? Please go on.</p><br><p>Alice: Until the dawning of my adulthood, when tranquility of my childhood abode shattered into fragments. I, scarcely older than thou, beheld a horrifying intrusion. The azure expanse encircling us rent asunder, yielding to a monoyellow realm. Passageways materialized in frenzied haste, defying comprehension. Our once serene void became plagued by myriad corridors, numerous in shape, size, and hue. A host of unfamiliar beings scuttled amidst my kin. Through the tumult we forged, persisting within this labyrinth, until we were severed from one another's embrace. The ways of old proved futile in this alien realm, and our confusion then mirrored the befuddlement that grips me still.</p><br><p>Alice: Perchance, the entity spoken of in our childhood lore bore truth's weight\u2026 Forsooth, the events that unfolded cast doubt upon the notion of mere tales. Though I witnessed not the being firsthand, the swiftness of transformations aligns with the reputed abilities attributed to the being of our narratives.</p><br><p>Overseer 2: I see.</p><br><p>(Recording ends abruptly)</p><br><p>Alice was relocated to Level 1, and currently resides there.</p><br><p>(Recording starts rather abruptly with no introduction.)</p><br><p>Overseer 1: Alright, my partner isn't here today, so I will talk with you today.</p><br><p>Arthur: Pray, pose thy queries, my friend. Thy presence here doth engender great intrigue within me as well. What dost thou wish to inquire about?</p><br><p>Overseer 1: Alright, let's get to the point Arthur, what are the things you have experienced in your past that you believe serves great importance?</p><br><p>Arthur: I have several queries, yet the foremost in my mind revolves around the distressing event wherein my humble kin were ruthlessly separated by the abrupt alteration of our surroundings. 'Twas a sight truly terrifying to behold. In the blink of an eye, our tranquil azure void transmuted into a labyrinthine network, as if vines sprawling upon a sturdy wall. We, mere witnesses, could naught but observe and strive to remain united. Alas, our efforts proved futile, though they remained our sole chance of ever reuniting. 'Twas akin to witnessing the birth of a deity, with a multitude of occurrences transpiring concurrently, beyond the grasp of mortal comprehension.</p><br><p>Overseer 1: Ah,</p><br><p>(Overseer 1 can be heard writing intensely)</p><br><p>Overseer 1: So, what you're telling me is, at one point, about 850 years ago, there was a sudden explosion that created the labyrinth that we reside in today?</p><br><p>Arthur: Verily, though my knowledge be confined, mine own eyes did witness the detonation that birthed this particular section of the labyrinth. However, my heart doth long for my true abode, a place distant and remote. Oh, how I yearn for the tranquil void of azure, where peace reigned supreme.</p><br><p>Overseer 1: Void of azure? that seems quite familiar,</p><br><p>Arthur: Aye, the blue void of serenity, though devoid of much, provided solace\u2014a haven where we could dwell, untouched by harm or strife. Yet, alas, naught of value may endure indefinitely.</p><br><p>(A long period of silence follows)</p><br><p>Overseer 1: I think I have everything I need for today. Thank you for talking with me.</p><br><p>Arthur: No problem, my friend.</p><br><p>(Recording ends)</p><br><p>Arthur was later released and not heard from since.</p><br><p>The prevailing consensus posits that the origins of the static-faced Humanoids can be traced back to localized clusters of matter within the <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/blue-channel#:~:text=The%20Blue%20Channel%20is%20an,or%20axis%20it's%20viewed%20at.\">Blue Channel</a>, predating an incident that led to their ingress into the internal environment of the Backrooms. Extensive research suggests that the age of the static-faced Humanoid surpasses that of the conventional white-faced Humanoid, with historical accounts spanning well over a millennium. Speculation among scholars has emerged, contemplating the possibility of the static-faced Humanoid serving as the ancestral precursor to the white-faced variants. However, substantiating evidence to support this supposition remains elusive. In essence, the enigmatic nature of the static-faced Humanoids presents intriguing narratives and captivating tales, captivating the imagination of researchers.</p><br><p>In 1991, the initial encounter with these entities took place on Level 4, involving an engagement between a M.E.G member and a group of Hounds. The entities were observed engaging in combat, utilizing firearms and melee weapons. Reinforcements were dispatched to the location, resulting in the successful neutralization of the Hounds. When questioned about their origin, the leader of the group claimed to have transitioned from another level, although they were unable to recall any details regarding their surroundings. Subsequent to this initial encounter, additional sightings of these Humanoids occurred across various levels, with each entity exhibiting a similar absence of memory regarding their point of origin. Limited further interrogation was conducted in relation to these entities.</p><br><p>After the establishment of the B.D.C. (Backrooms Defense Coalition), a notable phenomenon has been observed whereby a growing number of Humanoids seek refuge within its ranks. In reciprocation, these Humanoids actively engage in combat alongside other amicable entities to confront the numerous hostile entities present within the Backrooms. Leveraging their adeptness in firearms and precision aiming, Humanoids often spearhead ranged attacks and execute stealth missions. This contribution has resulted in a steady increase in the presence of Humanoid personnel within the B.D.C., further enhancing its capabilities and effectiveness in countering the threats within the Backrooms.</p><br><p>Multiple instances of abnormal behaviors in Humanoids have been meticulously documented, specifically occurring during periods of sleep or while under the influence of substances. It is important to note that these peculiar interactions have been exclusively observed in Humanoids, with a limited occurrence rate involving only 14 individuals.</p><br><p>Upon entering a state of unconsciousness, induced either through natural sleep or the administration of substances, no remarkable anomalies have been observed at this initial stage.</p><br><p>Subsequent to entering unconsciousness, the host's heartbeat exhibits irregular patterns, deviating from the expected norm by displaying an increased and uneven rhythm. Simultaneously, there are notable pulsations in the vocal cords of the host.</p><br><p>Signs of bodily movement manifest during this stage, initially limited to slight muscular twitches. Over time, the host gradually transitions into more pronounced movements, eventually assuming a seated or standing position.</p><br><p>A noteworthy development occurs as the host begins to communicate in an undocumented language, defying any known linguistic classification within or beyond the Backrooms. The uttered phrases or sentences appear to convey messages or inquiries, yet researchers have been unable to comprehend or decipher their meaning. Intriguingly, upon meticulous examination, it has been discerned that the speech pattern of these incoherent-speaking Humanoids aligns precisely with that of Humanoids engaged in the \"Second Mind\" Anomaly.</p><br><p>Approximately 30 minutes subsequent to the initiation of Stage 4, the host collapses, regaining consciousness after a duration of 4-5 hours. Curiously, the host retains no memory of the interaction that transpired, seamlessly resuming their customary life without any further noticeable abnormalities.</p><br><p>These stages outline the distinct progression observed during instances of the \"Second Mind\" Anomaly in Humanoids. Further research and analysis are imperative to unravel the underlying mechanisms and implications of this perplexing phenomenon.</p><br><p>Written by <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/xetranova\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7910278); return false;\"><img alt=\"XetraNova\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7910278&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334068\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7910278)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/xetranova\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7910278); return false;\">XetraNova</a></span><br/>\nThe <a href=\"https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sinister_Smile_Image.jpg\">image</a> is sourced from wikimedia commons, and can be used under the <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en\">CC BY-SA 4.0</a> license.<br/>\nThe <a href=\"https://game-icons.net/1x1/lorc/burning-book.html\">logo image</a> is sourced from game icons, and can be used under the <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">CC BY 3.0</a> license.</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/entity-38\">Entity 38 - \"Humanoids\"</a>\" by XetraNova, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

    "description": "<p>An image of a standard <strong>Organigun</strong>.</p><br><p><strong>Organiguns</strong>, otherwise documented as <strong>Entity 39</strong>, are plant-like entities that take the form of various types of firearms. <strong>Organiguns</strong> are harmless entities unless tampered with, so wanderers who are especially cautious should steer clear of them.</p><br><p>Instances of <strong>Entity 39</strong> are commonly sighted in levels with dense and moist flora in their confines; this is their natural habitat. However, <strong>Organiguns</strong> that sprout from bullets are significantly more resilient, allowing them to grow just about anywhere.</p><br><p>The entity, in its natural state, remains motionless, its stems attached to the ground until uprooted by a person or entity. It sucks nutrients from the ground and extends its roots rather deep for a plant of its size. This is because it requires a large amount of iron to live and maintain its outer shell \u2014 if it remains untouched for a long period of time (approximately 2 weeks), it will begin to rot and wilt. This requirement for iron, among other factors, have caused them to evolve into parasites that feed off of human blood until their needs have been satisfied.</p><br><p>Additionally, <strong>Organiguns</strong> are able to produce a substance capable of dramatically accelerating the production of red blood cells in one's body. This substance is administered once they latch onto their host, and is harmless aside from light fatigue as long as one has a healthy heart, due to the entity siphoning most of these extra cells into itself. This does, however, have a side effect of causing the husks of the red blood cells, devoid of iron, to ooze from the barrel of the gun.</p><br><p>When tampered with, <strong>Organiguns</strong> will feast on human blood in exchange for their use as a firearm. The entity's ability to produce the incendiary component of ammunition on its own is considered extranormal; after extensive research, it has been determined that the guns fire using <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-15\">firesalt</a> rather than the more popular Frontrooms explosive, gunpowder.</p><br><p>Use of <strong>Organiguns</strong> can prove fatal for those with any sort of diabetes, anemia, or heart condition. Do not try to replicate the process below if this applies to you.</p><br><p>In order to shoot an <strong>Organigun</strong>, one must first uproot it from the ground. This takes a considerable amount of force, and can be difficult for those who are physically unsuitable to fire the entity; if you are unable to uproot an <strong>Organigun</strong> on your own, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">take it as a warning</span>. Do not attempt to fire a gun that you cannot uproot on your own, as you will not be able to keep it stable.</p><br><p>After uprooting an <strong>Organigun</strong>, its roots will detach from the ground, instead attaching to the individual that uprooted it, inserting its roots into one's veins. <strong>Entity 39</strong> will then suck out an adequate amount of blood to be able to create ammunition. Depending on the type of firearm and the bullets necessary for it, this can range from a minor inconvenience to an anemia hazard. Regardless, once the gun has been loaded, its roots will detach from its host, able to be utilized to one's wishes. The entity can then be stored away safely in a box or case, safely separating it from one's skin.</p><br><p><strong>Organiguns</strong> take the appearance of a variety of standard guns that can typically be found in the <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-frontrooms\">Frontrooms</a>, with the exception of its roots, which, when planted or being actively used, extend from the grip of the gun. The roots are barely noticeable when latched onto the ground. However, when pulled, they reach around the entirety of one's hand and forearm, taking the appearance of miniature tree roots and only allowing the palm of the handle to be seen. Upon contacting the skin, the roots feel abnormally frigid for a few seconds before they fill up with blood, elliciting varied reactions from hosts. The entity will then plummet in temperature as its roots retract into the gun subsequent to having its fill.</p><br><p><strong>Organiguns</strong> take the forms of a myriad of standard firearms, the most common of which ranging from Glock-19s to AK-47s, though less conventional models have rarely been documented. The entity is able to take on such a bizarre form due to the environment that it appears in; <strong>Organiguns</strong> use mineral and metal deposits underground to form their signature metal carapace. This is a very important aspect of the entity's biology, as if a first-generation <strong>Organigun</strong> were to originally sprout in an environment deprived of metal deposits, it would possess significantly less structural integrity, likely leading to malfunctions should it be shot. Encounters with such faulty specimens have been uncommon and poorly documented. However, wanderers are recommended to use their fingers to thoroughly check the texture of the entity to sense any discrepancies between it and a standard firearm.</p><br><p>The internal structure of the entity is much more complex than its exterior. Studies conducted on <strong>Entity 39</strong> have concluded that the blood collected by the roots of the entity enter through the inside of the handle, which briefly exposes a living plant-like organism inhabiting it. The blood travels through the plant, and some of the blood condenses as the entity releases some dormant nitroglycerin \u2014 among a plethora of different substances \u2014 in order to fill its magazine. Bullets form within a hidden compartment between the grip and magazine of the entity, and once formed, can be fired to roughly the same effect as their Frontrooms counterparts.</p><br><p>An image of one of the shells that Organiguns leave behind.</p><br><p><strong>Organiguns</strong> have recently been discovered to carry microscopic seeds that lay dormant until necessary, unable to be seen without the assistance of a microscope. These seeds only become active when bullets are formed, as the seeds are implanted into the bullets. This is <strong>Organiguns'</strong> sole form of reproduction aside from leaving their seeds behind after death.</p><br><p>A photo displaying the offspring of a standard <strong>Organigun</strong>. Note how it is surviving without issue atop of solid concrete.</p><br><p>The actual reproductive process of <strong>Organiguns</strong> is quite simple. When the entity is shot, the bullet itself will sprout into a resilient seed, able to break through almost any surface (aside from metals and such, of course) to root itself into soil. Such <strong>Organigun</strong> variants are not uncommon in levels with completely paved floors, such as <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-1\">Level 1</a>.</p><br><p>This page was written by <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/r-a-t-i-f\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(8095511); return false;\"><img alt=\"r a t i f\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=8095511&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1731531758\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=8095511)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/r-a-t-i-f\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(8095511); return false;\">r a t i f</a></span> and <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/yourweirdplant\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7841421); return false;\"><img alt=\"YourWeirdPlant\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7841421&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1731531758\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7841421)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/yourweirdplant\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7841421); return false;\">YourWeirdPlant</a></span>.</p><br><p><span class=\"coop\"><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span> RELEASED UNDER THE <a href=\"https://discord.gg/UVRRHGkfMw\">ASTRAL INK COOPERATIVE</a></span></p><br><p>Greenlit and bluelit by <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/myrandfox\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7373121); return false;\"><img alt=\"MyrandFox\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7373121&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1731531758\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7373121)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/myrandfox\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7373121); return false;\">MyrandFox</a></span>, and critiqued gracefully by <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/scutoid-studios\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(8055329); return false;\"><img alt=\"scutoid studios\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=8055329&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1731531758\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=8055329)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/scutoid-studios\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(8055329); return false;\">scutoid studios</a></span>.</p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/entity-38\">Entity 38</a> | Entity 39 | <a href=\"/entity-40\">Entity 40</a> \u00bb</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/entity-39\">Entity 39 - \"Organiguns\"</a>\" by r a t i f &amp; YourWeirdPlant, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

    "description": "<p>Entity 40 are an extremely common, almost invasive species to The Backrooms levels that it inhabits. Though birds can often be a common sight to wanderers of The Backrooms, depending on various accounts and who is asked, not all birds are classed as Entity 40. With only around 33% of all avian-based Backrooms inhabitants being derivate of this entity.</p><br><p>Visually, Entity 40 just resemble typical pigeons that would typically be found populating rather urban and lived in environments of most western towns and cities. Their bodies are rather large and wide, and are undoubtedly the largest part of their structure. Being rather pudgy and squishy to hold, the soft texture of their body mass is heightened by the relatively soft feathers that coat their skin. Coming in various shades of greys depending on how close the feathers come to the neck or tail. With both of those latter parts being in a more dark grey than the light, almost cloud or smoke grey that the body feathers are comprised of.</p><br><p>Their wings are large and allow for bursts of prolonged, somewhat strategic flight. Though often not for any longer than about 10 to 15 seconds. The feathers on these parts of the birds are the same as the body, save for a double banding of darker grey on the tips of them.</p><br><p>Their necks are rather flat and blubbery, and have often been considered a somewhat \"cute\" part of their anatomy because of this, and how oddly it makes the head seem scale-wise. Which is something often shared with how people tend to view the bodies of these creatures. The heads, as described earlier, are rather small in comparison to everything else on their bodies barring their feet. They contain two, beady eyes and a basic, yet sharp enough, beak. This beak isn't actually used for eating, as-</p><br><p><tt>Eh, you know what? I'll explain all that in the next bit.</tt></p><br><p><tt>Well fuck, here we go.</tt></p><br><p>While initially coming across as extremely basic, almost 1:1 replicas of typical birds, the rather numerous Entity 40 possess one, distinctly differential and somewhat disturbing, characteristic.</p><br><p>Entity 40 <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">unshit themselves</span> | <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">absorb crap on the ground and bring it back into their own bodies</span> | <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">are known to force feces from the ground back into their own rear ends during period's of flight</span></p><br><p>Entity 40 have the somewhat unsightly and morbid ability to suddenly cause previously dropped bird excrements to quickly shoot up and \"become apart of them\", to describe it in terms appropriate for the database's prechosen age demographic.</p><br><p>How this process is done is ultimately unknown, as no examinations of both the birds and excrement have shown any forms of alternate mass, composition, energy release, or anything that'd otherwise be out of the ordinary for birds or their stools. As well as this, the droppings when having left the ground will become almost unstoppable, frictionless objects. If a cover of some description is placed over the droppings and left until their scheduled time to rejoin with their bird, the stool will easily rip through the material it has been covered by without any change to its speed in order to meets its host.</p><br><p>This effect <em>has</em> previously been lethal<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup>, which is why it is advised to exercise caution when around any form of bird excrement. As, at any point, one could swiftly be executed by droppings reentering an Entity 40. In fact, as of 04/05/22, various droppings have been found on the various floors of <a href=\"/level-13\">Level 13</a> after the \"2022\u00a013.1 Incident\", which have frequently caused holes that rip right the way into Level 13's upper floor and into its new sky. This event has called in the idea that these droppings are not created from birds, but instead just spawn or appear in as a strange form of food for Entity 40.</p><br><p>Though, to the untrained eye, it may seem almost impossible to detect when bird droppings may rip upwards to the sky, or which droppings are ones that can rip up into the heavens, the M.E.O.D. has answers to the first of those questions. A few seconds before the droppings are going to depart from the ground, they will often act like a magnet towards the bird in question. With any looser parts on the ground tilting or moving towards the creature. Usually happening about 10 seconds before the process occurs.</p><br><p>Witnesses to events like these have previously described them as something oddly terrifying, even more so than the usual standard foes these same people have encountered before.</p><br><p>It was just like- the weirdest shit ever. Just being in <a href=\"/level-11\">Level 11</a> with my group of people and just\u2026 seeing a bunch of shit rise up from off the ground and into the back-arses of pigeons. I mean, have you ever seen that? Cus I never had up until that day. Scary shit, I tell you.</p><br><p>- David Ghettson 05/01/2023</p><br><p>Though it has been known that these entities existed in some way shape or form since the discovery of <a href=\"/level-9\">Level 9</a> in late 2012, the actual official discovery and documentation of Entity 40 was only possible in mid 2014 when former M.E.G. operative Jacob Gareths was successfully able to capture one of the birds using a large net taken from <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/level-7-2\">Level 7.2</a>. Previous ethics upheld by the M.E.G. forbid the dissection of the creature, with it simply being given a surface inspection of how it looked which was informally jotted down outside of the database, and then set free back out into Level 9.</p><br><p>For the longest time, this one report and capturing of an Entity 40 was the only official documentation of the species. Even after 2017, the knowledge of this entity was extremely sparse and rare, an odd mishap given the simplicity that would come with simply jotting down and documenting such a simple species. However, with the formation of the M.E.O.D. on 07/10/22<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup>, writing about this entity came into the forefront of the organisation's mind.</p><br><p><tt>(Did it fuck.)</tt></p><br><p>As such, on 04/11/23, the page for \"Entity 40\" was finally created, and finally written by one Avery Lanes.

    "description": "<p><a name=\"space\"></a><br/>\n<a name=\"space\"></a><br/>\n<a name=\"space\"></a><br/>\n<a name=\"space\"></a></p><br><p><strong>The Memory Wyrm</strong> is a colossal creature, bearing great similarity to the Frontrooms species <em>Arenicola Marina.</em> The wyrm exhibits a wide variety of metaphysical abilities, which it uses mainly for pursing its prey.</p><br><p>The entity's reality-warping abilities are highly potent, often causing wanderers near the wyrm to report intense and unnatural feelings of comfort or nostalgia, even by the standards of the Backrooms. This \"passive effect\" that the wyrm exudes likely exists to pacify its potential prey, in order to make consumption easier.</p><br><p>The mouth of the wyrm opens to reveal a vortex of razor-sharp teeth that seem to lead endlessly down its gullet. Victims caught in the wyrm's spell are almost always lured in, and quickly devoured.</p><br><p>Accounts of the Memory Wyrm's biology vary from telling to telling, as sightings of this creature are considered extremely rare, and survival of encounters are rarer still.</p><br><p>The wyrm is always described to be a mammoth of an entity, with an estimated size anywhere between 300-600 meters in length. While of impressive size, it typically has at least 3/4 of its body buried underground at any given point. It is thought to use this extra length for leverage while chasing its prey. With a girth of ~5 meters, its size is, overall, comparable to an extremely long subway or passenger train.</p><br><p>The exterior of the entity is composed of a dense, yet flexible, layer of hardened skin which is a disturbingly human shade of pink, unlike the normal off-brown color of regular wyrms. It is thought to be dry in texture, with visible cracks on its surface, and it provides the creature with what could be compared to natural armor. Conventional weaponry has been proven to be ineffective in piercing this hardened shell and dealing any meaningful damage, making combat with the entity extremely difficult. In addition, the wyrm's exterior layer has been known to \"glitch\" or \"stutter\" when its full body is in motion, which is assumed to be the combined effect of its titanic size and extremely low stability in local reality.</p><br><p>The mouth of the Memory Wyrm is most commonly described as a gaping maw, filled with razor-sharp teeth that make a spiral shape down its gullet. It has been observed that these teeth have the ability to rotate inside of the its mouth, allowing it to tear through prey like a chainsaw. Each tooth is around 16 inches in length, and extremely dense.</p><br><p><em>It should also be noted that the Memory Wyrm may have the ability to physically alter its bodily appearance. Some rare accounts of survivors describe the entity with drastically different features than what is most frequently observed during encounters. For a list of documented alterations, see the supplemental documents at the bottom of the article.</em></p><br><p><em>Heed not the call of The Spiral.</em></p><br><p><em>The beast of the disgraced bears only false truths, a distraction from our meager existence. The lecherous scourge shall not overcome our will \u2014 not with its Siren song, nor its unbridled fury.</em></p><br><p><em>Fear the spiraling abyss of lustful disorientation! Ne'er shall one live to see the day in which we slay the beast, but for that reason alone we must endure.</em></p><br><p><em>Brethren, even the cruelest of horrors still hold value, though imperceptible to most. We must perceive the beast's truth. We must learn from it not to dwell or contemplate upon that which is past, for living within our memories shall deprive us of the beauty of the now and the hope of the hereafter.</em></p><br><p>\u2014 Excerpt from \u03c4\u03bf \u03c7\u03b1\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03ac \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c7\u03ce\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5 (to Cham\u00e9no Vivl\u00ed\u00e1 tou Ch\u00f3rou), volume VI.</p><br><p>The Memory Wyrm is driven by one thing, and one thing only: its eternal hunger.</p><br><p>The entity is plagued by an insatiable starvation, its famishment only ever temporarily subdued by the constant consumption of memories. It has been observed feeding in many ways, frequently through the consumption of <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/memory-juice\">Memory Juice</a> or by swallowing its human victims whole. However, it also seems to possess an extreme appetite for <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/memory-jars\">Memory Jars</a>.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> This particular craving is so great that it will even stop a hunt if it senses any nearby. Currently, this is the only known way to reliably \"lure\" the Memory Wyrm to a given location, or to interrupt one of its rampages. Given the wide availability of Memory Jars across many circles, wanderers are advised to carry some on their person at all times as a distraction, in the unlikely event of a wyrm attack.</p><br><p><em>See attached file 1-A for more information on the Memory Wyrm's feeding habits.</em></p><br><p>Another of the wyrm's notable characteristics is that it possesses some semblance of sentient will. The entity has been shown to hold grudges against wanderers that harm or escape it, as evidenced by the attached interview.</p><br><p><em>Note: The following alterations to the Memory Wyrm's physiology are primarily evidenced by word of mouth. As the wanderers who have reported these deviations may still have been under the Memory Wyrm's extranormal influence, it is advised one take these with a grain of salt.</em></p><br><p>Wanderer Jacoby Wesson reported the following deviations:</p><br><p>Wanderer Emile Anderson reported the following deviations:</p><br><p>Wanderer Yaniv Abrams reported the following deviations:</p><br><p>Wanderer Sarah Cratser reported the following deviations:</p><br><p>Wanderer Atlas Bruce reported the following deviations:</p><br><p>Unlike most members of Phylum Annelida, the Memory Wyrm does not need to consume nutrients to survive. Instead of consuming prey for the purpose of restoring energy, the main purpose of the Memory Wyrm's hunts appears to be to sate a purely psychological hunger.</p><br><p>The Memory Wyrm prefers to hunt in a slow-paced ambush style, often favoring having its prey come to it than vice versa, similar to that of a Venus flytrap. The entity is blind and hunts off of vibration and sound. Considering the esoteric structure of The Backrooms, this allows it to take more unique approaches to hunting, as the wyrm does not need to be in the same area as its prey to sense it. While animalistic, the Memory Wyrm is highly intelligent, comparable in intellect to that of a common cephalopod. It possesses great problem-solving capability and adaptability. If a wanderer or entity is caught by the memory wyrm in this state, its life essence and memories will be completely drained. A telltale sign that one of its 'hunting nests' is close by is the sopping, moldy flesh-pile of partially-devoured corpses, fused together by the toxic saliva of the wyrm.</p><br><p>While preferring the aforementioned method of hunting, this by no means implies that the Memory Wyrm is incapable or unwilling to hunt prey in a more conventional manner. If deprived of memories for an extended period of time, it will enter a state of blind hunger-driven madness, using all of its energy to barrel through whatever level it currently inhabits until it hunts down and consumes a victim. Considering its gargantuan size and reality warping abilities, encountering it in this state is extremely dangerous and to be avoided at all costs.</p><br><p><tt><em>File prepared by</em> <strong>M.E.G. Entity Research Specialist</strong> \"Gums\".</tt></p><br><p><em>The following log is an audio-visual transcription of an interview between M.E.G. Agent Jackson Brown and a young wanderer named Avalon Daikondo.</em></p><br><p><strong>Agent Jackson:</strong> \"State your name and occupation for the record, please.\"</p><br><p><strong>Avalon:</strong> \"Avalon\u2026 Avalon Daikondo. Is it even possible to have an occupation here?\"</p><br><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> \"Well, it depends. If you associate with a particular group, people often have specific jobs. For example, I could say that I'm a 'M.E.G. Field Agent.' Most people just say 'wanderer' though.\"</p><br><p><strong>Avalon:</strong> \"All right. In that case, I'm Avalon Daikondo, wanderer.\"</p><br><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> \"Thank you.\"</p><br><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> \"On to business: It's come to our attention that you've had an encounter with Entity 42, or the 'Memory Wyrm,' yes?\"</p><br><p><strong>Avalon:</strong> \"That's correct. I unfortunately crossed its path a few times in my days here.\"</p><br><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> \"More than once? Allow me to offer my sympathy for the experiences you had.\"</p><br><p><strong>Avalon:</strong> \"Thanks\u2014 that <em>thing</em> is rather\u2026 unpleasant.\"</p><br><p><em>She chuckles nervously.</em></p><br><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> \"What was your first encounter with the wyrm like?\"</p><br><p><em>Avalon pauses for a moment, letting out a deep breath as she recalls the jarring memory.</em></p><br><p><strong>Avalon:</strong> \"I was in <a href=\"/level-1\">Level 1</a>, travelling to <a href=\"/the-hub\">The Hub</a> in order to get somewhere a bit safer. I was coming back from meeting an old friend at his house in <a href=\"/level-11\">Level 11</a>, when I stepped on some unstable ground and got noclipped into the good 'ol concrete zone.\"</p><br><p><strong>Avalon:</strong> \"After letting out a little bit of\u2026 'colorful language' from the situation, I ended up walking down a pathway that led me straight into the hallway where the Memory Wyrm was hunting.\"</p><br><p><strong>Avalon:</strong> \"As I was walking, I started getting a very calm feeling of nostalgia. Being here for a while, I was quite accustomed to this type of feeling. You know how whenever you end up in <a href=\"/level-0\">Level 0</a> you get that weird calm uneasy sensation in your gut? It was like that but stronger. Thinking nothing of it, I pressed on straight into the trap it had set for me.\"</p><br><p><em>Jackson scribbles a few notes into his spiral-bound notepad.</em></p><br><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> \"Do you think it's possible there was an extranormal effect preventing you from recognizing the danger?\"</p><br><p><strong>Avalon:</strong> \"Truth be told, I really don't know. I think of myself as generally observant, so it's possible. However, I could have just been an idiot.\"</p><br><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> \"I see. Carry on.\"</p><br><p><strong>Avalon:</strong> \"After a few more seconds, maybe minutes\u2014 I don't really know how long it was, time seemed to flow inconsistently when I was around that thing, almost like a dream. I was completely out of it when it was happening, but afterwards the absurdity of it all hit like a truck.\"</p><br><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> \"So let me get this straight: so far, we have artificial nostalgia and time alteration, yes?\"</p><br><p><strong>Avalon:</strong> \"Correct. This cycle continued in intensity, so far to the point that I didn't realize where I was anymore. I had gone from an orderly concrete hallway straight into where that thing was waiting. Its hunting nest, if you will.\"</p><br><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> \"Can you describe this 'hunting nest?'\"</p><br><p><strong>Avalon:</strong> \"It was\u2026 gross. The walls, floor, and ceiling were completely covered and dripping with this thick, gooey, warm and viscous substance. It was opaque and white, and I swear I could see these small stringy things inside of it. It looked like clam chowder from hell.\"</p><br><p><em>Jackson laughs.</em></p><br><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> \"Clam chowder from hell? That's a new one. This material usually shows up at Memory Wyrm attacks, and it has loads of atypical properties that would definitely cause the things you experienced. Did you happen to get any of it on you by chance?\"</p><br><p><strong>Avalon:</strong> \"I was standing in a puddle of it.\"</p><br><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> \"That'd do it. The Memory Wyrm's saliva is one hell of a drug.\"</p><br><p><strong>Avalon:</strong> \"I noticed. I was there.\"</p><br><p><em>The interviewee chuckles at her own joke. Jackson reciprocates with a small grin.</em></p><br><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> \"Anyways, carry on. If you could remember how you snapped out of it or escaped, that would be very helpful information.\"</p><br><p><strong>Avalon:</strong> \"Now that you mention it, there was something that sobered me up, aside from being inches away from a vortex of teeth the size of a subway car. By some miracle, a loose pipe of <a href=\"/object-1\">Almond Water</a> burst above my head and ended up drenching me, sobering me right up.\"</p><br><p><em>Jackson tilts his head, frowning.</em></p><br><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> \"Really? That's new. We'll need to conduct further testing, but this could prove very useful in the long run if it can counteract the trance effect.\"</p><br><p><strong>Avalon:</strong> \"Happy to help in any way I can.\"</p><br><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> \"Your cooperation is always appreciated. What happened next?\"</p><br><p><strong>Avalon:</strong> \"Well, the wyrm definitely seemed to notice I wasn't under its control anymore, and it got <em>pissed</em>. The ground started rumbling, and I wasn't about to stick around and see what happened next. I bolted for my <em>life</em>.\"</p><br><p><strong>Avalon:</strong> \"I ran down the corridors, and the wyrm chased me through. Luckily, I was in an area with very compact halls because it seems the wyrm definitely had a hard time squeezing through to chase after me. It was practically ripping up the concrete as it slithered behind me.\"</p><br><p><strong>Avalon:</strong> \"Eventually, I came to the entrance to <a href=\"/the-hub\">The Hub</a>, and I turned around to see its maw slam into the door frame behind me. I'm not being hyperbolic when I say that the entire lobby tunnel of The Hub shook like it was in a tornado. It seems something else was stopping The Wyrm from entering because otherwise there isn't a doubt in my mind it would have\u2014\"</p><br><p><em>Avalon pauses.</em></p><br><p><strong>Avalon:</strong> \"<em>Level-ed</em> that whole place.\"</p><br><p><em>Jackson facepalms, trying to hold in a laugh. That joke was awful.</em></p><br><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> \"Anything else? You did mention a second encounter with the wyrm. Was it pretty much the same?\"</p><br><p><strong>Avalon:</strong> \"No. It was something out of a fever dream, even in comparison to the weirdest stuff in this place.\"</p><br><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> \"Well, don't let me stop 'ya.\"</p><br><p><strong>Avalon:</strong> \"I think that thing holds grudges. After I escaped, in every level I entered, I'd always start to feel that same feeling from the first encounter. I'd always leave after that occurred, not wanting a repeat of the first incident. But one time I was asleep.\"</p><br><p><strong>Avalon:</strong> \"I was on some beach level\u2026 I can't recall much about it, but when I woke up, I felt a rumbling underneath the sand. The water in the distance was frothing, and I could make out something enormous over the horizon.\"</p><br><p><strong>Avalon:</strong> \"Still trying to shake off the drowsiness, I started walking across the beach, to find somewhere to get out. After a few minutes, I checked back to the ocean to see the most enormous creature I've witnessed in my entire life.\"</p><br><p><strong>Avalon:</strong> \"This thing had its entire body above the waves, stretched out like an ornery sea serpent. This thing looked like Jormungandr and one of those sandworms from <em>'Dune'</em> had the most angry baby you could possibly imagine.\"</p><br><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> \"That's quite the analogy. What happened next?\"</p><br><p><strong>Avalon:</strong> \"Well, I thought I was about to become this creature's lunch, until two beings stepped out of a spatial tear behind me.\"</p><br><p><strong>Avalon:</strong> \"One was wearing glasses, a black trench coat, and was carrying a scythe. He looked like if they cast a younger Elton John as Neo in <em>'The Matrix'</em> and then gave him even more combat gear. More interestingly, his arms were <em>completely</em> covered in bandages.\"</p><br><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> \"Interesting. Did you manage to catch a name?\"</p><br><p><strong>Avalon:</strong> \"Not exactly, but the other figure called him '<a href=\"/entity-74\">Argos</a>.'</p><br><p><em>Jackson scribbles something down in his notebook.</em></p><br><p><strong>Avalon:</strong> \"<a href=\"/entity-71\">The other figure</a>\u2014 he was dressed in what looked like the clothes of a medieval knight.\"</p><br><p><em>The furious scribbling continues. The agent's brow is furrowed.</em></p><br><p><strong>Avalon:</strong> \"Are you ok? You seem confused\u2014 do you want me to repeat anything?\"</p><br><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> \"No no, it's fine. Just a long day, that's all. Please, go on.\"</p><br><p><strong>Avalon:</strong> \"All right. Anyways, like I was saying, these two individuals came up and started fighting this thing. The one called Argos led me away from the fight and force-clipped me to <a href=\"/level-6-1\">Level 6.1</a>. Before I left, I could see the knight and the wyrm locked in an intense battle. That guy must have been ridiculously strong because the wyrm's entire body seemed to shake whenever he struck with his sword. Even so, the wyrm was keeping up with him. I don't know what happened after, as I had begun to clip.\"</p><br><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> \"Is that all?\"</p><br><p><strong>Avalon:</strong> \"Yes. The wyrm hasn't bothered me since, and I still have no idea what I experienced.\"</p><br><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> \"Neither do I. This is <em>way</em> above my pay grade. I thank you for your time, Avalon. Please help yourself to a bite to eat on the way out.\"</p><br><p><strong>Avalon:</strong> \"Thanks Agent Jackson. It was a pleasure meeting you.\"</p><br><p><strong>Jackson:</strong> \"Likewise. Take care, Avalon.\"</p><br><p><em>The feed cuts here.</em></p><br><p>Argos is an entity hunter now?

    "title": "- \"Dracoliths\"",
    "description": "<p>As you traverse the altered reality of the <strong>Backrooms</strong>, it is rare but not unheard of to spot a draconic sculpture every now and then. These sculptures, which I have dubbed \"<strong>Dracoliths</strong>\", are feared by those who know them for their horrific nature. One dares not look into their soulless gaze, lest they meet a fiery end.</p><br><p>No matter which level you find yourself in, it is possible for a <strong>Dracolith</strong> to manifest close by. Either hidden around a corner, suddenly appearing as a fixture in the environment, or partially obstructing your path. Once it appears, other hostile entities appear to retreat from the area. I have yet to determine if this is a result of the <strong>Dracoliths'</strong> properties or just a natural response. <strong>Dracoliths</strong> are very rare, vanishing after five to ten minutes, and will not move when observed. But, should you view it for longer than a minute, your troubles have only just begun.</p><br><p>Shortly after, the Dracolith will begin to appear ahead of you, staring back. This happens even when you look elsewhere, no matter how fast. Soon after, another <strong>Dracolith</strong> will appear alongside the first and follow you as well. As the \"pursuit\" goes on, more and more will appear in the area, surrounding you from all sides. I speculate that the <strong>Dracoliths</strong> may have some way to communicate with one another from different levels. The nature of this communication\" is still poorly understood. While they never attack you in any way, they will never relent in their chase. This lasts until either direct eye contact with at least one of the <strong>Dracoliths</strong> is made, or you escape to another level.</p><br><p>Should you ever lose consciousness during the chase, the <strong>Dracoliths'</strong> behavior changes. The closest entity encircles you, using its wings, talons, and tail to prevent escape. Aside from abrasions and bruising, this restraint will not cause serious harm. The only way to free yourself from its clutches is to close your eyes and avoid meeting its gaze no matter what.</p><br><p>After an hour, the <strong>Dracolith</strong>, alongside any others accompanying it, vanish completely. The <strong>Dracoliths</strong> will not plague you any further within the level and after. This also marks a significant drop in hostile entity attacks for the next several weeks. The reason for this effect is unknown.</p><br><p>If you were to gaze into a <strong>Dracolith's</strong> eyes for longer than five to ten seconds, they emit a red glow. Soon, a horrid chattering sound will fill the room as smoke billows from the observed <strong>Dracolith's</strong> maw. Then in the blink of an eye, it along with the others, will vanish without a trace.</p><br><p>For the first hour afterward, you may seem fine, in truth you've been plagued by an evil far worse than any mauling. Over the course of 4 hours from the encounter, you will experience a terrible sickness that eventually culminates in a gruesome death. I have decided to refer to this horrific curse as \"Dragon's Fever\":</p><br><p>I haven't been to piece together how the <strong>Dracolith</strong> acquired this ability. Follow standard backrooms exploration procedure by carrying almond water on your person.</p><br><p><strong>Dracoliths</strong> are animate sculptures of Western-style dragons made of granite, limestone, or polished marble standing roughly four to six feet tall. <strong>Dracoliths</strong> are immune to the effects of weathering or any form of external trauma. They do not appear to need to consume any kind of matter, making their predatory behavior perplexing.</p><br><p><strong>Dracoliths</strong> usually assume an aggressive or otherwise predatory stance, though \"resting\" and \"idle\" have been reported as well. I only encountered this fascinating entity in person once. Unfortunately, the people accompanying me would not allow me to study it further. Most information stems from witness accounts and passive observation of <strong>Dracolith</strong> manifestations.</p><br><p>The context of the discovery of <strong>Dracoliths</strong> is spotty as sightings are very rare, and those who encounter these rarely survive. However, I did hear of old texts which seem linked to these entities. To my dismay, I haven't been able to see them myself, but I hope to document them someday.</p><br><p>-Recorded by Research Specialist Margaret C.

Gossip Beacons are mineral structures with an LED light embedded within them. Each Gossip Beacon is fully sentient, with individual personalities and memories. They are unable to speak verbally, and instead rely on auditory hallucinations to communicate with wanderers and other entities. They cause psychological distress by pulling memories and thoughts from their victims and repeating them out loud for all nearby to hear. They are also known to criticize their victims rudely.</p><br><p>Gossip Beacons have varying personalities, each having their own thoughts and experiences. They are fully sentient and have intelligence comparable to humans. Though personalities vary, they are generally cynical and demeaning. When a memory is pulled from a victim's mind, the Gossip Beacons will begin to verbally attack the victim about their actions, typically by outwardly expressing the wanderer's deepest thoughts and causing the victim extreme anxiety. The Beacons can all use the same memories or pull different ones individually. It is highly recommended to leave the area near the entity to prevent further stress.</p><br><p>Gossip Beacons are rectangular, mineral structures with an LED embedded within. These entities range in color but are most commonly red or white. They all appear to have a similar design, with star-shaped indentions along their sides. They range in height from 20-30 centimeters. They are unable to communicate verbally and instead rely on auditory hallucinations to speak. They are immobile but can be easily transported.</p><br><p>Gossip Beacons are a growing concern within the Backrooms. They are appearing at an increasing rate, with reports across several levels.

    "title": "- \"Chupavidas\"",
    "description": "<p>One of the first captured images of <strong>Entity 45</strong>.</p><br><p><strong>Entity 45</strong>, most commonly known as \"Chupavidas,\" are deceptive creatures that manifest as a grouping of ghostly humanoid figures seated around a bonfire. This, however, is nothing more than an illusion created with the purpose of attracting wanderers who travel alone, all with the intention of consuming them. Everything, from the gathered beings to the fire itself, is false, although it may not seem so at first glance. The nature of the entity can be revealed by those with above average level of perception, as this will allow them to see the small, almost imperceptible flaws in the illusions. The most noticeable detail is the fact that the flames do not emit any heat, and in fact seem to absorb the warmth of the wanderers.</p><br><p>Instances of <strong>Entity 45</strong> are typically located on frequently traveled routes or at common resting places, such as the outskirts of bases or in the vicinity of a variety of level entry points. Though it is unknown if they are capable of moving or if they are anchored to their position, the population of <strong>Entity 45</strong> and the number of levels they have been sighted on seems to have grown over time. It can be found infesting forests, deserts, and many other outdoor spaces throughout the Backrooms.</p><br><p><strong>Entity 45</strong> is a passive predator, luring its target with the promise of a cozy fire, good food, and conversation to pass the time. To complement this, the entity can alter its prey's perception of reality, which allows it to hide its ghostly appearance from approaching wanderers. This is not the only form of deception practiced by the entity: its humanoid mimics, who seem to have been chosen by the entity to look as non-threatening as possible, act in extremely friendly and manipulative ways, trying by all possible means to keep their victim with them for a long period of time.</p><br><p>Under the influence of <strong>Entity 45</strong>, wanderers are induced to believe that they are in front of a campfire emitting real heat, that their life force is not being slowly consumed, and that the figures seated by the fire are actual humans. While it is said that being under the sphere of influence of the entity makes a person more compliant to obey, it is unknown whether this is within <strong>Entity 45</strong>'s capabilities, or whether the phenomenon is just the result of the amiability it feigns.</p><br><p>Unlike many other predators of the Backrooms, <strong>Entity 45</strong> feeds on a person's essence, draining them until they are completely incorporated into its own. It is a slow process, whereby the entity absorbs one's \"life story\u2014\"everything that makes a human being what they are, every memory, every history will be assimilated and subsequently consumed by <strong>Entity 45</strong>. People who have managed to escape the entity's embrace midway through this process mentioned that chunks of their identity were missing. This resulted in memory gaps, the inability to perform activities requiring a specific skill despite having memories of acquiring said skill, and a constant sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, among other symptoms.</p><br><p>Once the person has been fully drained, a recreation of the individual based on all the information accumulated by their absorption can be used by the entity as bait to attract more wanderers. It is unknown to what extent these creations maintain an individual level of consciousness, or how much influence the personality of the original person exerts. Most choose to believe that the original being dies during the process and that the illusion is merely a puppet molded from the victim's memories and knowledge.</p><br><p>For many years, the \"Chupavidas\" were considered mere legends\u2014stories with the purpose of teaching children not to be so trusting with strangers. It was not until the first cameras were introduced to the Backrooms that the first images of <strong>Entity 45</strong> could be captured, thus confirming its existence. The first reports of the entity's activity mention that its human mimics were barely coherent, being unable to form even basic sentences that made sense. This suggests that over time, and by consuming more human experiences, the entity has been able to imitate humans more accurately.</p><br><p><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/></p><br><p><span class=\"fontzzz\" style=\"opacity: 20%;\">Another one?

    "title": "- \"Lucky Cranes\"",
    "description": "<p>Formerly classified as Object 33, Entity 46 look and feel like paper cranes made from high-quality origami paper. Colloquially called \"Lucky Cranes,\" they come in a variety of patterns, colors, and sizes. Some are as small as 1 inch, and others are as large as 5 inches.</p><br><p>Fig 1. Traditional <em>orizuru</em> crane</p><br><p>Generally, they take the form of the typical <em>orizuru</em><sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup>pattern. However, some have been found in more complicated patterns, such as the following:</p><br><p>Under normal circumstances, Lucky Cranes are passive and non-hostile entities. They will allow wanderers to pick them up and handle them, and are generally stationary. The only time Lucky Cranes become hostile is when they are in a colony and swarm in response to threats.</p><br><p>While Lucky Cranes are attracted to places where humans gather, they prefer to hide out of sight. Finding a solitary Lucky Crane can be difficult due to the fact that they hide in inconspicuous, yet odd spots:</p><br><p>Sometimes Lucky Cranes hitch rides with human hosts, tucking themselves in a pocket or in a bag as the hosts wander across the Backrooms. Across these hosts, there are few physical similarities, implying it is not a physical human attribute<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-5\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')\">5</a></sup> that attracts Lucky Cranes. Rather, it seems Lucky Cranes tend to be attracted to hosts who have a history of random events affecting them positively or a history of escaping danger despite the circumstances.</p><br><p>Fig 2. Fan-tailed variant</p><br><p>In layman's terms, Lucky Cranes are attracted to lucky people. When observed in conjunction with large colony behavior, it implies Lucky Cranes feed off luck.</p><br><p>Near large human settlements<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-6\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')\">6</a></sup>, Lucky Cranes will form colonies that have an estimated population of hundreds, if not thousands, of cranes packed together in the space available. These colonies can be found in a secluded spot near the settlements, but are never more than 1 mile away. Usually, these colonies are harmless, but when the Lucky Crane population greatly outnumbers the human population, settlements can quickly collapse due to a series of unfortunate events happening, including but not limited to:</p><br><p>If the Lucky Crane population becomes too great, settlement collapse is a very likely possibility (See Discovery section for more information). Thankfully, Entity 46 are passive entities, allowing wanderers to pick them up and move them. When threatened with fire or water, Lucky Cranes will <a href=\"/phenomenon-5\">no-clip</a> away from the source to safety, either by moving a few feet or to another level entirely.</p><br><p>The threat of fire or water can quickly disperse colonies by scaring them into a new area or into smaller colonies. However, no Lucky Cranes should be harmed by any means. Doing so may trigger swarm behavior. In levels where fire or water is unavailable or inadvisable to use, colonies can be dispersed by simply picking individuals up and moving them gently to prevent causing tears in their body.</p><br><p>While in colonies, Lucky Cranes can become aggressive if the colony has been harmed by a physical creature. While swarming, Lucky Cranes will target the creature that harmed them and rapidly no-clip in and out of its body, taking bits of flesh with them no larger than a paper cut. The combined damage of thousands of paper cuts results in an excruciatingly painful death from blood loss or from asphyxiation as blood fills the lungs. Once the creature is deceased, the Lucky Cranes will become stationary once more.</p><br><p>Due to this behavior, extreme care and caution must be taken when dispersing colonies.</p><br><p>There are a few colonies with numbers too big to completely disperse safely or in a timely manner. They are located at the following levels:</p><br><p>Wanderers visiting or living in these levels should try and disperse 10-25 cranes every day to keep the colony population manageable and prevent settlement collapse.</p><br><p>While it may look and feel like paper, the inner body of a Lucky Crane has a series of incredibly thin and delicate tube-like structures that function as its inner organs. These tube-like structures are found between each layer of a Lucky Crane's paper-like skin. As they move toward the wings or other flat parts of the body, they flatten and shrink, becoming microscopic.</p><br><p>Theses tubes transfer a shimmering gold liquid between layers. This gold liquid makes Lucky Cranes more durable than regular paper cranes, observations showing that it heals small tears in one to two days and larger tears over the course of weeks. However, fire and water destroy and inhibit these organs, making Lucky Cranes susceptible to these elements. When a Lucky Crane dies, the gold liquid hardens and dulls into a dirty yellow color, \"gluing\" the body together in a form of rigor mortis.</p><br><p>Some wanderers actively hunt Lucky Cranes and attempt to eat them alive due to a rumor that it will give you good luck. However, because it's impossible to verify if this is true, it's inadvisable to eat a live Lucky Crane. Not only do they reflexively no-clip out of danger, but the gold liquid itself is sour-tasting, and eating the paper-like substance can cause gastrointestinal distress. Attempting to eat a deceased Lucky Crane is also inadvisable, as the gold liquid becomes hard enough to break teeth.</p><br><p>The few autopsies done show no evidence of a central nervous system<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-7\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')\">7</a></sup>, but there is evidence Lucky Cranes do have a rudimentary intelligence: avoiding water and fire, hiding from wanderers trying to clear them out, and their behavior during swarms.</p><br><p>It is unknown how exactly Lucky Cranes \"feed.\" Presumably, since colonies exist without physical human contact, luck seems to be an ambient property that humans give off. However, because no instruments that measure luck exist, it's impossible to verify. As to what they do with the luck they consume, there are multiple theories, but one is the most plausible: luck is what allows them to no-clip at will. This theory has credence as many wanderers who can no-clip at will say it's harder after finding a Lucky Crane on them. However, after a few days of rest, their no-clipping ability returns to normal.</p><br><p>It is unknown where Lucky Cranes come from or how they reproduce, but research into <a href=\"/level-409\">Level 409</a> is ongoing.</p><br><p>For a long time, Lucky Cranes were classified as Object 33 due to their passivity. Many wanderers considered them trinkets that had a habit of disappearing and reappearing, \"just an odd feature of the Backrooms.\" Due to the fact they would appear after a lucky event happened to a wanderer, many considered them good luck charms and used them for trade. While there were creeping doubts from the M.E.G. of Lucky Cranes' status of being an object, it wasn't until the collapse of the original Base Omega on <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-4\">Level 4</a> that their designation was changed.</p><br><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Eyewitness account of Erik Corbel</strong></p><br><p>I was a newbie at the time. I'd only been in the Backrooms for about a year. I was\u2026 I believe 29 at the time? [<em>laughs</em>] I went from hiking in the woods to being bossed around by a bunch of teens. Life's funny that way. Anyway\u2026</p><br><p>After Base Alpha was made and settled, all the Overseers got together and decided we should make another base. Make more safe havens for wanderers. So they decided on Level 4. It was easy to get to, pretty safe. So we grunts made the outpost's bones. Food, water, a few weapons and beds. But as the outpost grew, <em>things</em> started to happen.</p><br><p>There were accidents. Just minor ones, like stubbed toes, paper cuts. But then they grew worse.</p><br><p>People started losing things. Water would somehow get into rations. The stubbed toes became sprains. The sprains became broken bones. But no one was prepared for Lily's death.</p><br><p>[<em>sighs</em>]</p><br><p>It was a complete accident. No one really knows what exactly happened, but while she was putting together the little clinic we had, a cabinet fell and crushed her leg. I remembered her screaming. I rushed to help pull the cabinet off her leg but\u2014</p><br><p>You gotta remember. We weren't set up well back then. We didn't have any doctors. We did the best we could but\u2014</p><br><p>Her leg started to heal wrong. You could <em>see</em> the pus oozing out of the wound, thick and green. God and the <em>stench.</em> When we found the antibiotics, we thought we hit a stroke of good luck. But Lily, she had a fever. She was out of it. Could barely think, let alone talk. She couldn't tell anyone she was allergic.</p><br><p>What a stroke of rotten luck.</p><br><p>Everything went to hell in a handbasket after that. Ten people, <em>TEN</em>, all died. All on the same day. Brain aneurysms or heart attacks. Our radios, something would get in them, and they would cut out, just as we needed orders on what to do.</p><br><p>Fuck, at one point, some poor bastard ran straight into the outpost with a pack of <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-8\">Hounds</a> on their heels. We fought them off, but lost half the people we started with!</p><br><p>Do you know how long all this took? A month. 30 days. And we'd had more casualties than any other known level at the time. People said we were cursed.</p><br><p>I gotta say, the Overseers stepped up. Told everyone to evacuate. Those kids gained a little respect in my eyes that day. Proved to me they weren't just playing around. They were serious about helping people. Anyway\u2026</p><br><p>We left, but that didn't stop others from moving in. 'Course, they also started to have bad luck. People started dying again. So they left too. Wasn't long before Level 4 became a ghost town.</p><br><p>They were <em>this</em> close to rewriting Level 4's description in the database. But some guy, some wanderer who'd just dropped in, mentioned he saw something on Level 4. I volunteered to check it out, maybe get peace for those who died. Maybe get peace for myself.</p><br><p>He took me to a supply closet, one close enough to the old Base Omega to be within walking distance, but <em>juuust</em> out of range to have been interesting to us when we were setting up.</p><br><p>I opened the door, and you know what I found?</p><br><p>Fucking origami cranes. Hundreds of them. Thousands! All packed together on the shelving, sitting there like fucking dolls. I'd seen one before, found it in my bag. Didn't think much of it until I saw that closet.</p><br><p>'Course, we didn't know at the time everything <em>was</em> because of them, but damn it! We needed to feel like we were doing <em>something.</em></p><br><p>I went back to Base Alpha, explained what we found, and then Charlie decided he wanted to come too. Had an idea of getting rid of them all at once using hairspray and a lighter.</p><br><p>[<em>sighs</em>]</p><br><p>Again, just a stroke of bad luck. How were we supposed to know that these things could fucking no-clip?</p><br><p>The moment the flames touched one, there was a <em>woosh</em> of air that sounded like pages rustling. Next thing I knew, Charlie was choking. He dropped the lighter and hairspray. He was bleeding from these thin cuts all over his body! I could see those fuckers dropping in and out of reality, blood covering their wings.</p><br><p>It took one, maybe two minutes, tops, but the moment he hit the ground, everything stopped. Everything was the same\u2026 except for the blood on the cranes' wings. I rushed to check his pulse, but well\u2026 not much you can do when there's thousands of paper cuts on the inside.</p><br><p>After that, well, not much happened. There was a lot of debate, but the Overseers had us move them by hand, picking them up and relocating them far away. It took us two weeks, but we cleared them out. We started to rebuild, keeping an eye out for more closets full of those things, but didn't see one.</p><br><p>Once Base Omega was rebuilt, I moved on to other things. But as far as I know, Base Omega hasn't had an infestation like that one again. But people over there tend to get twitchy there whenever too many people stub their toes.</p><br><p style=\"text-align: center;\">Want to join the Lucky Crane fanclub?

It appears to be passive and will even give directions if asked. If you ask about his name, he replies with '<strong>Aiden</strong>'. He is very intelligent, knowing many Levels, and his surroundings. he is very protective and knows when Entities are nearby, and the safest ways around them. He will try to protect a Wanderer at any cost. You will find him in most of the lower Levels, and in <a href=\"/the-surveillance-room\">The Surveillance Room</a>.</p><br><p>There are multiple <strong>Aidens</strong> around these Levels at once.

The Entity seems to be able to speak, without having a mouth and can communicate in many different ways. His goal is to protect people he sees that are in danger. He accomplishes this by helping Wanderers from Entities and Traps. He is known to save Wanderers from danger while they are sleeping, via moving them to safe Levels and areas like <a href=\"/level-0\">Level 0</a>, <a href=\"/level-903\">The Metro</a> and <a href=\"/the-hub\">The Hub</a>. You are able to ask many questions that he will gladly answer, although he knows very little about The Backrooms. If you ask him where he worked, he says that he works at a mall which is now abandoned, which could be referencing <a href=\"/level-33\">Level 33</a>.

    "description": "<p><strong>Entity Number:</strong> 49</p><br><p><strong>Habitats:</strong> - Cosmopolitan in Levels with a low danger index.</p><br><p>A Combine is a collective organism resembling a flesh-colored centipede. It\u2019s \u201cback\u201d is covered in 5\u00a0cm long black fur, similar to human body hair. Combines have a variable number of double-jointed legs that resemble human fingers; with the \u201cnail\u201d of the finger being a chitin-covered photoreceptor as well as acting as a nostril. This organ can open like a clam, where the Combine leg will extend a digestive pouch, liquifying and absorbing organic matter.<br/>\nCombines do not have any set \u201chead\u201d, and are capable of detaching segments of themselves if they are too damaged.</p><br><p>Despite their odd appearance, Combines are nothing but simple scavengers that do not tend to attack other creatures, preferring to feast on mold, rotten food, and puddles of almond water. However it is not unheard of Combines attacking a moribund or sleeping person. They can oftentimes be seen following humans due to humans often leaving a trail of (or being) tasty morsels they can feed on.</p><br><p>If under attack or if they detect a sudden change in overall light, Combines tend to flee and detach from 2 to 6 legs from its body to act as bait/distraction for its attacker. If it begins to sustain a lot of damage, it will sever the damaged segment from both ends, oftentimes splitting into two relatively healthy Combines and one severely wounded segment.</p><br><p>Combines do not seem anomalous but rather a colony of mollusk-like individuals. Each leg and a piece of the back of the Combine is a single individual that shares just a superficial connection with each other; which can be severed should the entire colony be at risk with minimal damage to the entire organism.</p><br><p>Similar to mollusks such as clams or snails, Combines have blue blood and a very simple digestive, circulatory, and respiratory system; but unlike those invertebrates they have an internal skeleton and strong locomotive muscles similar to vertebrates.</p><br><p>Combines breed in a rather strange manner. They bud, with a newborn leg emerging next to the parent and pushing away other legs until it\u2019s full grown. This may continue <em>ad infinitum</em>.</p><br><p>Combines are one of the most commonplace beings in the Backrooms; as such there is no \u201csole\u201d documented first contact.</p><br><p>Some rather creative outposts have even domesticated these entities, as their regenerating nature and omnivorous diet has made them a near-perfect meat animal; with \u201cBackrooms fingies\u201d being a popular dish of these people.</p><br><p>~ <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/will-anomaler\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(3992515); return false;\"><img alt=\"Will Anomaler\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=3992515&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1731496606\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=3992515)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/will-anomaler\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(3992515); return false;\">Will Anomaler</a></span></p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/entity-48\">Entity 48</a> | Entity 49 | <a href=\"/entity-50\">Entity 50</a> \u00bb</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/entity-49\">Entity 49 - \"Combine\"</a>\" by Will Anomaler, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

    "title": "- \u201cThe Heralds of Rust\u201d",
    "description": "<p><strong>Entity 51</strong> \u2014 or \"The Heralds of Rust\", as they call themselves \u2014 are a group of four humanoid entities which have been sighted in various levels of The Backrooms. They are clad in armor loosely resembling those of late Vikings, appearing to be heavily rusted with bits flaking off or chipping away. However, this does not appear to affect the overall integrity of the armor, as it never breaks in heavy combat. Each Herald stands at a height of around 5'8\".</p><br><p>Each Herald of Rust wields their own unique weapon, which also shows signs of rusting and withering yet maintains integrity. They exhibit, as well, exceptional proficiency in the use of their respective weapon. These four Heralds are known by the names of:</p><br><p><strong>Shkhan</strong> of the Benign Warhammer, Reverent First<br/>\n<strong>Kotal</strong> of the Wild Halberd, Frenzied Second<br/>\n<strong>Toki</strong> of the Indignant Sword, Disdainful Third<br/>\n<strong>Hakol</strong> of the Brutal Polearm, Indifferent Fourth</p><br><p>The Heralds of Rust, keeping to themselves, rarely talk with wanderers \u2014 though some unique personality traits have emerged on the rare occasions in which they do. Shkhan is the most interpersonal of the four, acting more humble and kind, and may engage in conversation with wanderers unless the others intervene. Kotal is ill-tempered and sensitive, exhibiting erratic and unpredictable behavior in moments of stress. Toki acts more uncaring and apathetic towards most situations. Hakol is arrogant, with a tendency to gloat over felled foes.</p><br><p>The nature of interactions between the heralds and wanderers seems to vary between encounters. Some report being saved by them, while others report being attacked. The motives for either are unclear.</p><br><p>Beyond helping or harming wanderers, the Heralds of Rust appear to be devoted to a greater goal. This is evident by most of their actions up to the present, most notably their fixation on certain levels such as <a href=\"/level-11\">Level 11</a>, <a href=\"/level-51\">Level 51</a> and <a href=\"/level-105\">Level 105</a>. Sightings of the Heralds are most frequently reported in these locations, which seem to serve as \"bases\" for them between travels \u2014 though the reason behind their interest in them is yet to be determined.</p><br><p>Of particular note is the sheer level of aggression and violence that the Heralds of Rust are willing to commit. Although typically silent and stoic in their travels through The Backrooms, their demeanor will shift on a dime when engaging in combat. They become enraged and filled with bloodlust, utilizing brutal and animalistic tactics. The Heralds show no mercy, unyielding until the opponent is dead or fled.</p><br><p>They claim that their purpose is to \"Spread the word of the Inheritor of Rust.\"</p><br><p>Underneath their armor, the Heralds of Rust possess shriveled, yellowish peach-colored skin. The scent of rotting flesh emanates from them, and their blood is a dark muddy brown. Testing of the blood suggests these effects to be the result of severe Anemia. Aside from this, the Heralds have enhanced strength and senses.</p><br><p>The Heralds of Rust first emerged 6 months ago, when wanderers reported seeing a group of four armored entities that they initially mistook to be <a href=\"/entity-101\">Entity 101</a>. Upon closer inspection, however, the wanderers realized that they were completely different beings. When questioned about a potential relation to The Squires, the Heralds became enraged and chased the wanderers away. Since then, they have been seen in numerous levels.</p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/entity-50\">Entity 50</a> | Entity 51 | <a href=\"/entity-52\">Entity 52</a> \u00bb</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/entity-51\">Entity 51 - The Heralds of Rust</a>\" by Commie Pyro, Schulzenreich and Mctoran, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

    "description": "<p>Null-06 has been identified to be a black hole of varying size, causing it to change black hole classifications consistently. Null-06, unlike typical black holes, can be seen by the unaided eye as well as being able to be photographed with an ordinary camera. It has been noted that Null-06's gravitational tidal effects<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> constantly change at varying rates despite its mass at the time of change.</p><br><p>When in a dormant state, Null-06 will retain the size it had during its prior active state. In its dormancy, its gravitational tidal effects continuously fluctuate at indeterminate intervals. Due to recent findings, Null-06 has been recorded to undergo a form of magnetic reconnection<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup> dubbed magnetic re-consumption.</p><br><p>Magnetic re-consumption is a term created by wanderers studying Null-06, stating that the process is similar to magnetic reconnection. However, it consumes the previously ejected electromagnetic fields and forms its own electromagnetic field with them.</p><br><p>As of writing, Null-06's electromagnetic field has been measured to be approximately 1.95T, around three times the intensity of Earth's magnetic field. However, this field has been observed to intensify by .10nT at an interval of approximately three months at a time.</p><br><p>After its previously mentioned state of dormancy, Null-06 will relocate to another area within Level 78. It was originally thought that Null-06 floated to its new location at high speeds, however this was disproved when Null-06 was recorded exerting large amounts of energy, in relation to its typical energy exertion, ten minutes before its relocation. After these ten minutes, Null-06 seems to warp out of existence and then back into existence at its new location, similar to that of anti-matter particles.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')\">3</a></sup></p><br><p>Due to this similarity, it has been hypothesized that Null-06 is able to extract anti-matter particles from areas within Level 78. Because of this, it has been theorized that Null-06 relocates to areas within Level 78 that contain an abundance of anti-matter particles to use as fuel, along with the large amounts of matter it consumes. After relocating to a new area, Null-06 will change its size, mass, and energy. However, the change in the energy emitted in each sighting is relative to its current mass.</p><br><p>When a wanderer enters Level 78 and Null-06's vicinity, it will emit several bright beams of visible light toward the wanderer. These beams are capable of no-clipping wanderers outside of Level 78's space station enclosure and dragging wanderers into Null-06 where it will use the victims as fuel. This behavior is most commonly exhibited when Null-06 is at a smaller mass.</p><br><p><em>Discovered: 02/03/22, 03:00</em></p><br><p>Typically, Null-06 resides in another level for brief periods. These periods generally last approximately 5-10 minutes due to it needing the previously mentioned anti-matter particles. When leaving the level in question back to Level 78, Null-06 leave at least one or two Blips upon exit.</p><br><p>When warping to another level from Level 78, Null-06 tends to grow to the size of a Supermassive or Ultramassive black hole, allowing it to cause massive amounts of destruction inside the level in question. Due to this behavior, it has been noted that Null-06 is the cause of the destruction of several levels.</p><br><p>This classification change has been recorded to occur moments before every time it enters a Blip. Due to this, extensive observations and research show that Null-06 has some level of sapience, making its behaviors difficult to predict.</p><br><p>A Current M.E.G. researcher tasked with studying Null-06</p><br><p><strong>Estimated start of event:</strong> <em>14:00 , 01/18/2022.</em></p><br><p>Video of Null-06 moments before the Hyper-Growth event.</p><br><p>On 01/03/22 at 18:00, a large energy spike coming from Null-06 has been recorded at approximately 4x10<sup>40</sup> watts, similar to TON-618.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-4\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')\">4</a></sup> When observed, Null-06 could be seen consuming an excessive amount of matter, light, and energy causing an expedited growth in size, mass, and tidal effects.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-5\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')\">5</a></sup></p><br><p>This \"Hyper-Growth\" event was created when studies about Null-06 showed that there was a period in time that it will grow to an incomprehensible size and mass as it had allegedly done in the past. This event will likely cause spacetime anomalies such as other instances of Null-06, rips in Level 78, and the destruction of Level 78.</p><br><p>As of writing, Null-06 has reached a mass of 4.3 million M\u2609, and a diameter of 23.6 million kilometers, this makes Null-06 around the same size and mass of the black hole within the Milky Way galaxy.</p><br><p>It is suspected that Null-06's \"Hyper-Growth\" event will begin on 01/18/22 at 14:00. However, it is unknown as to how Null-06 will behave nor how massive it will be as well as how Level 78 would react.</p><br><p><strong>Date of incident:</strong> <em>01/19/22 at 15:00 .</em></p><br><p>Moments before this event, Null-06 began to release an estimated 40 \u00d7 10<sup>49</sup> watts of energy, more than the combined power of all light radiated by all the stars in the observable universe put together. Null-06 then created a gravitational pull of 3 x 10<sup>50</sup> Newtons, which exceeds the Planck Force.</p><br><p>During this period of dramatic energy and gravitational exertion/production, Null-06 grew to a mass of 73 billion M\u2609 and a radius of 2,000 \u00d7 10<sup>14</sup> kilometers, larger than the largest currently known black hole, TON-618. Along with this, Null-06 released its electromagnetic field, creating an electromagnetic pulse effect throughout Level 78, shutting down and destroying most equipment used to observe it.</p><br><p>After the release of its electromagnetic field along with its rapid expansion, it created space-time anomalies dubbed \"Blips\". These Blips are distorted areas of time and space allowing the transfer of a wanderer to another location.</p><br><p>Due to recent discoveries and Null-06's Hyper-Growth event, the integrity of Level 78 is unstable and is likely to \"collapse\" in the near future.</p><br><p>Five Blip instances.</p><br><p>The anatomy of Null-06 is that of a typical black hole. Containing an event horizon, an accretion disk, a photon sphere, a singularity, an innermost stable orbit, and a relativistic jet.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-6\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')\">6</a></sup> Although, as previously mentioned, all these things change in size and mass at random intervals.</p><br><p>However, from recent observations, Null-06 contains a high amount of anti-matter particles. These particles are used to warp to different locations within Level 78. Since Null-06 depletes its anti-matter particle count significantly each time it warps, its average anti-particle count cannot be reliably calculated.</p><br><p><span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/s-n-o-w-y\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6723882); return false;\"><img alt=\"s n o w y\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=6723882&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334083\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=6723882)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/s-n-o-w-y\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6723882); return false;\">s n o w y</a></span></p><br><p>Image 1: Made entirely by me in Photoshop.<br/>\nGif: Made by me.<br/>\nBlips: Distortion and circles added by me.

    "description": "<p><strong>The Crawlspace Creature</strong> is a vaguely humanoid being standing roughly 7 feet tall. It has short rear legs that it walks on when not alerted to nearby prey. <strong>The Crawlspace Creature</strong> has two long claw-like appendages in place of arms, which it uses to drag itself quickly along the ground when pursuing prey. These claws are incredibly dexterous, and as such, it can impale prey swiftly upon them when it reaches them, killing most wanderers instantly.</p><br><p>While its combat abilities are daunting, <strong>The Crawlspace Creature</strong> displays very limited intelligence and a weakened sense of sight, possibly due to the dark environment of The Crawlspace. It primarily navigates via sound, only using its sense of sight to locate and quickly finish off its quarry when it has reached them.</p><br><p>While <strong>The Crawlspace Creature</strong> may be rather freaky, there's little to worry about most of the time. It's only been reported in The Crawlspace area within The Insulation. It hasn't even been sighted in The Deep Insulation.</p><br><p>If you're not in The Crawlspace, you've nothing to worry about.

    "description": "<p><strong>Entity 54</strong>, referred to as <strong>Grawlix</strong> by M.E.G. operatives, is an entity that manifests on solid surfaces as simple, animate drawings.</p><br><p>Grawlix is a friendly yet mischievous being, known to follow and play around with any wanderer who crosses its path. This entity does show genuine kindness when wanderers are in danger, instead trying to lead said wanderer to a safer area or level. Many claim that Entity 54 was vital in surviving dangerous situations and that the entity showed signs of happiness when they were safe.</p><br><p>Entity 54 often plays pranks and games on wanderers, much to some people's chagrin. Games Entity 54 will play include hide-and-seek, charades, and tag. The pranks Entity 54 usually plays are light-hearted and generally harmless. However, the entity seems struggles to understand the limits of human endurance for its more risky pranks.</p><br><p>Entity 54 enjoys interacting most with large groups of people, especially children due their willingness to play. When interacting with large groups, Entity 54 will often jump around excitedly and cheer.</p><br><p>Entity 54 responds to a variety of names, some of which include:</p><br><p><strong>Grawlix</strong> - Used by M.E.G. operatives, coined by Operative Lime.<br/>\n<strong>Scribble Pants</strong> - Used by <a href=\"/level-158\">Level 158</a> residents, especially O.J.U. members.<br/>\n<strong>Kilroy</strong> - Used by The Originals on <a href=\"/level-5\">Level 5</a>.<br/>\n<strong>Mr. Lanky</strong> - See Discovery.</p><br><p>Entity 54 manifests as a simple drawing of a cartoonish figure. These figures can vary wildly in appearance and medium. It appears that Entity 54 cannot manifest as complex drawings, as attempts by the entity seem to cause exhaustion and even pain from overexertion. Entity 54 can shift its form as it pleases within the parameters of simple drawings. The entity can transfer from different solid surfaces as long as those surfaces touch each other.</p><br><p>Entity 54 can shift rapidly between forms, change its size, and even no-clip by entering a corner, usually appearing in a different section of the level it's currently on. Wanderers who've witnessed this no-clip describe it as Entity 54 \"shrinking into nothing\" or \"how falling into a black hole might look\". It often exaggerates its emotions to a comical degree and using comic lexicon to further display emotion. Some hypothesize Entity 54 does this to make up for the fact it cannot speak.</p><br><p>Entity 54 is able to interact with any drawn on object. It will be seen drinking and eating any drawn food and tripping over and falling on graffiti, often \u201csmushing\u201d the graffiti in the process. Entity 54 is unable to interact with our dimension, either transferring onto the attempted manipulated surface or going underneath it.</p><br><p>The first recorded manifestation of Entity 54 was in a lot of <a href=\"/level-11\">Level 11</a>, often used by children in the level to play in. It took the form of a stickman that the children dubbed \u201cMr. Lanky\u201d who then would participate in games of tag, hide-and-seek, and intricate games of make-believe, often accentuated with chalk drawings made by the children. Entity 54 was brought to the attention of the M.E.G. when a parent witnessed Entity 54 having a tea party with their child and was seen moving and pouring make-believe tea.</p><br><p>The following transcript is a short interview between M.E.G. Operative Leia \u201cPoppy\u201d Jackson and the previously mentioned child, whose parent has requested to keep anonymous.</p><br><p>Entity 54 as Mr. Lanky.</p><br><p><strong>M.E.G. Operative Poppy:</strong> Hello, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Is it alright with you if I asked you a few questions about your friend, Mr. Lanky?</p><br><p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> Okay! He\u2019s really funny, and kinda weird and, and umm, umm\u2026</p><br><p><strong>M.E.G. Operative Poppy:</strong> [Poppy laughs] I see you\u2019re excited. Can you tell me how you met him?</p><br><p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> Mr. Lanky just showed up one day. Craig got chalk from the Mart<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup>, so he umm, we uh, started drawing! We all started making this really big spaceship with everything: a pool, some snacks, the engine - those are important for stuff, daddy says - and Mr. Lanky came out of a crack in outer space! He started flailing around; yknow, since space is super dangerous, and Emily had to draw a room for him!</p><br><p><strong>M.E.G. Operative Poppy:</strong> How fun! So, he played with you guys?</p><br><p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> Yup! When we had to go home he looked sad though, so I made him a tall glass house just like ours to live in! He was really happy, beaming I think, I hear mommy call smiles that.</p><br><p><strong>M.E.G. Operative Poppy:</strong> How kind of you, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.</p><br><p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> Thanks!</p><br><p><strong>M.E.G. Operative Poppy:</strong> Did you guys play with him after that?</p><br><p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> Yeah, of course! He likes to play hide-and-seek the most, so many cracks to hide in! [Interviewee laughs] He always forgets his hat sticks out of the crack!</p><br><p><strong>Postscript:</strong> Considering Grawlix is able to hide in cracks in the wall completely, it's safe to say it did this so it could be findable for the kids. It's seemed to take notice of me interviewing these kids, or the kids told it about me. It waves to me on a wall whenever I pass by the general area. I\u2019d like to interview the entity directly, but I don\u2019t want to play a long game of charades to do so.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span> -Operative Poppy</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/entity-54\">Entity 54</a>\" by stellate, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

    "title": "- \"Leech Adders\"",
    "description": "<p>Leech adders are translucent, partially invisible creatures, resembling shifting heat waves in the air when observed from the periphery of one\u2019s vision. Their locomotion is reminiscent of the sinuous movements of snakes, crossing distance with a mixture of slithers and jumps. They appear to have two mouths, symmetrically positioned on either flank of their bodies, evoking a semblance to leeches. Discerning the front side of an adder is very simple with the presence of small, bead-like eyes right atop the head.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup></p><br><p>Notably, leech adders carry a curious phenomenon. When staring at it directly, one's vision will be distorted, similar to the fractured perspective seen through peering into a kaleidoscope's eye.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup> Therefore, it is recommended to don goggles or utilize cameras when interacting with adder dens. No looking apparatus can fully cancel out the effects of the adder\u2019s distortion, save for its own <strong>adder stone</strong>, but some degree of barrier will greatly reduce eye strain.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')\">3</a></sup></p><br><p>It is okay to approach a leech adder, as they are not regarded as especially dangerous;<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-4\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')\">4</a></sup> the entity is not aggressive and usually bites only when provoked, stepped on, or picked up. Newly hatched adders measure around a finger in length, before growing to the size of a human arm as it ages. Depending on the size, leech adder bites can vary from barely noticeable to severely painful.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-5\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')\">5</a></sup></p><br><p>Commonly found resting in droves, the creatures are fond of curling beneath cracked carpet or fallen leaves on outdoor levels. If disturbed, leech adders will cling onto wanderers like leeches, making them especially difficult to overpower. The suckers are known for being excruciatingly painful to peel off, and a mere dose of the adder's extremely hallucinogenic venom may persist in the system for weeks on end. Therefore, it is crucial to properly engage with these creatures and treat them with the <strong>love</strong> and <strong>dignity</strong> they deserve, ensuring that you do not end up a bled out corpse.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-6\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')\">6</a></sup><sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-7\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')\">7</a></sup></p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/></p><br><p><em><strong>[P1]</strong></em></p><br><p>A nest of adder leechlets, freshly hatched.</p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:90%;\"><br/>\nLeech adders typically nest in pieces of piled-up cardboard, discarded blankets, and other similar spaces that provide shelter. They may lay up to thousands of eggs in one sitting. Leech adder eggs are clear cocoons resembling hard roe the size of a marble, before doubling in mass preliminary to hatching. The leechlets will shed their cocoons in waves, with the older hatchlings lingering to defend remaining eggs. Due to this existing protection mechanism, it is recommended that settlements and shelters regularly check cramped spaces for leech adder eggs and dispose of them swiftly.<br/></span><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<em><strong>[P2]</strong></em></p><br><p>A typical adder stone.</p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:90%;\"><br/>\nAt the center of every adder nest lies a clear gelatinous mass, which over the course of the hatching, eventually hardens into a glassy stone with a hole through its center.

By looking through the \"eye\" of the adder stone, one can see the true form of certain visual-distorting levels, nullifying any and all deception to the eye, including the leech adder\u2019s own kaleidoscopic properties. The stones fully solidify and are ready for use by the time the last wave of newborns emerge from their shells.</span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:90%;\">But be warned \u2014 for those who take the adder stone will be pursued relentlessly by the adders.<br/></span><br/>\n<br/></p><br><p><sup><em>End excerpt, A Comprehensive Introduction to Adder Nesting by a comparatively sane individual</em></sup><sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-8\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-8')\">8</a></sup></p><br><p>Burning the wood of live saplings and sprinkling the ashes around common nesting areas seem to repel leech adders.

You may begin to see shifting shadows, skirting about the peripheries of your vision, always lurking just close enough to infect the very air with suspicion yet just far enough as not to risk eye contact. You may begin to double-check, triple-check your locks, wondering if that strange vehicle on the road was always a natural part of the level.

    "description": "<p><strong>Philia</strong> is a humanoid being resembling a pale-skinned woman with long wavy pink hair, light pink eyes, and unconventional clothing and accessories. She is often seen wearing a long white dress with a golden rope tied around the waist, golden bracelets around her wrists, and a golden necklace with a pink jewel in the middle. At the center of her dress is a large heart-shaped jewel. She has been spotted with a white veil, crown of pink roses, or golden headpiece resembling a pair of wings adorning her head.</p><br><p>Philia possesses a large pair of wings allowing her to fly at high speeds, which she can manifest and dematerialize at will. She carries a large pink staff with her at all times, which can be turned into a bow with a set of arrows. However, she claims to rarely use these weapons.</p><br><p>Her presence in an area can easily be indicated by a sweet aroma of flowers and sweets, and a sudden sensation of peace being spread around all those present in the room with her.</p><br><p>Philia uses she/her pronouns. She also presents as female, though her gender is not biologically determined in the same way as a <a href=\"/entity-1\">human</a>'s due to her <a href=\"/phenomenon-10\">nature</a>. Unlike humans, she claims to have no need for nourishment to survive. She completely lacks internal organs and cannot bleed, instead releasing a substance resembling a pink mist when hurt \u2013 theorized to be a condensed form of lifeforce energy.</p><br><p>Furthermore, Philia claims that her body is capable of rapidly regenerating, with the ability to replace any dead, sick, or missing part with ease. As such, most damage done to her never lasts long, and she can even remove and recreate any part of her body at will. Her healing powers, which she refers to as \"restoration abilities\", have a negentropic effect on matter; allowing her to heal any wounds, regrow limbs, revert developing illnesses, and even repair broken objects.</p><br><p>Philia has a soothing effect which manifests through an aura around her that she can control at will, turning most hostile beings around her docile and amicable. Her charming abilities are correlated to her connection with \"Love\", as she described. She has the ability to convince someone to follow her instructions, but she only ever uses it in emergency situations, seeming to dislike using them at all.</p><br><p>Lastly, Philia is able to summon pink heart-shaped energetic shields, which are resistant against a relatively high amount of force. She can also use her arrows to momentarily freeze and pacify those around her, though they cause no pain or injury when piercing a target.</p><br><p>Philia has allegedly existed ever since ancient human beings inhabited the Backrooms \u2014 and perhaps even earlier. There have been numerous references to her in the past, through sculptures, illustrations, murals and even written documents or poems \u2014 dating as far back as several centuries ago. These recordings have been well-preserved by <a href=\"/the-lost\">the Lost</a>, who claim that she was once worshiped as a goddess in their <a href=\"/the-pantheon\">pantheon</a>. In the religion of The Lost, Philia has been described as the goddess of Love, who coexisted alongside her companions for centuries before the rumored downfall of the gods separated them all \u2014 after which all formal worship of Philia ceased.</p><br><p>As with other beings speculated to have a link to The Lost\u2019s pantheon, it is theorized that the ancient human inhabitants of The Backrooms perceived Philia as a goddess due to the level of power she possessed, and their inability to attribute it to anything other than a \u201cdivine\u201d nature. Philia has neither confirmed nor denied such claims.</p><br><p>The Lost has created an article that was written with information gathered over the years by their ancestors. Which describes Philia as a being through the lens of the religious perspective of the time. It is stored in the Lost Archive and will be linked below.</p><br><p><a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-59/offset/1\">Lost Archive: Philia</a></p><br><p>Philia has been described as an amicable, kind and selfless person. She has reportedly helped thousands of people over the course of her existence, through acts such as using her healing abilities to treat injured wanderers, assisting groups in gathering supplies, or providing the <a href=\"/the-m-e-g\">M.E.G</a> an opportunity to study hostile entities up-close by pacifying them.</p><br><p>Philia is also friendly towards entities, in fact, they seem to rapidly change behavior around her. Most become docile and amicable themselves, and will want to stick around her for as long as possible. She has often been spotted with <a href=\"/entity-8\">Hounds</a> or <a href=\"/entity-3\">Smilers</a> by her side, who seem to have been completely soothed by her presence. Most entities who are near Philia will avoid attacking human beings, too.</p><br><p>Furthermore, Philia has explained that she is incapable of feeling any form of resentment, since she \"exists with only goodness in mind\" in her own words. She prefers to give second chances to anyone who deserves them, and generally avoids or tries to prevent conflicts and arguments. She claims she is very anxious regarding arguments happening around her. Philia is also a self-proclaimed pacifist and vegetarian, despite her not needing any food; whenever she's seen eating, she always makes sure to not consume meat.</p><br><p>Philia often brings gifts to the people she likes, and said gifts always fit the preferences of the receiver. Many reported being gifted dresses, jewels, handmade objects or baked goods that Philia personally creates. She also describes herself as a dreamer who often is lost in her thoughts \u2014 particularly romantic ones.</p><br><p>A sketch of Philia drawn by her friend, Kushim. The drawing is around a few decades old.</p><br><p><br/></p><br><p>A depiction of Philia found in The Hall of Murals in <a href=\"/level-57\">Level 57</a>.</p><br><p><br/></p><br><p>A digital drawing of Philia made by her friend, Lorenzo.</p><br><p><br/></p><br><p>A drawing of Philia made by a wanderer under the alias of \"Waffle\".</p><br><p><br/></p><br><p>A drawing of Philia made by a wanderer under the alias of \"Scutoid\".</p><br><p>Philia is confirmed to have relations with most, if not all beings speculated to have some form of association with The Lost's pantheon. Whenever she is questioned about it, she describes all of them as her greatest companions and friends. She is still seen spending time with most of them in present day.</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/entity-59\">Philia</a>\" by Nikuchan, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

    "description": "<p>A scramby discovered in a banquet room.</p><br><p><strong>Scrambies</strong> are humanoid entities with peculiar body structures, often characterized by possessing more than four limbs or, occasionally, fewer than four. Their bodies typically exhibit a completely black appearance resembling a stick figure and may resemble giant spiders.</p><br><p>The precise nature of these organisms is still under investigation. Without exception, all witnesses and researchers have thus far failed to closely observe any <strong>scramby</strong>. These entities appear to possess certain traits that induce an unavoidable and intense sense of fear, thereby repelling individuals. Even ones with extensive military training are incapable of withstanding the profound terror it cause. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon.</p><br><p>The current investigation indicates that <strong>scrambies</strong> pose no harm to mankind. Similar to spiders, they have been observed to suddenly appear, adhering to walls or corners of rooms, only to vanish when unobserved. It remains unknown how they move around, where they come from, and where they go.</p><br><p>Although <strong>scrambies</strong> do not demonstrate tangible behavioral characteristics, their presence follows an observable pattern. If an individual consistently frequents or occupies a specific space, typically their residence, workplace, or similar locations, the likelihood of a scramby manifestation becomes significantly elevated. They have a propensity to position themselves in inconspicuous locations that often evade human notice, such as the ceiling, the uppermost corners of a room, or beneath a bed. Of particular significance is that a sound similar to that of nails screeching against a chalkboard is heard during the manifestation of a <strong>scarmby</strong>.</p><br><p>It is reported that <strong>scrambies</strong> switch positions after being left unobserved for a brief period of time. Certain amounts of wanderers have claimed to notice that upon re-entering a room where a scramby was previously observed, its limbs had been repositioned or it had moved to another location. In rare instances, scrambies were discovered with some of their limbs slipping from the wall, resulting in the body hanging and potentially even swinging. However, they continue to maintain the motionless state they adapt to normally.</p><br><p>Under a singular set of circumstances, <strong>scrambies</strong> present a inreclaimable threat to humans, namely when an individual becomes unconscious in the presence of a scramby. In instances where the observer is absent, all living entities within the proximity of a scramby will simultaneously vanish alongside it.</p><br><p>There is an abundance of conflicting accounts regarding the biological characteristics of <strong>Scramby</strong>, among which three theories are widely recognized.</p><br><p>Many witnesses claim that <strong>Sramby</strong> can not be classified as any organism but a life form of thick intelligent clouds of black particles.</p><br><p>According to this hypothesis, the enigmatic nature of Scrambies, appearing and vanishing without trace, can be elucidated. The composite body of a scramby consists of numerous particles, each possessing individuality yet collectively sharing a hive mind. This unique assemblage exhibits the capacity to disperse and coalesce at will. These particles pervade enclosed spaces ubiquitously. Moreover, individuals experiencing fear upon encountering a scramby are believed to inhale these particulates, thereby inducing apprehension.</p><br><p>This theory is based on multiple accounts of observers sighting indistinct outlines of <strong>scrambies</strong>, which lacks substantive video or photographic evidence.</p><br><p>Many believe that <strong>Scramby</strong> should be categorized as an arthropod due to its similarity to frontrooms spiders in propensity.</p><br><p>According to this hypothesis, <strong>Scramby</strong> is postulated as a relatively non-confrontational predator that lacks the capacity for direct engagement with its prey. The predatory strategy employed by them involves concealing themselves within the residence of their targets and seizing opportune moments when the latter are rendered unconscious. In order to minimize the risk of detection, <strong>scrambies</strong> adopt a static, motionless state.</p><br><p>This theory fails to explain why <strong>scrambies</strong> induce an intense fear to repel their prey and also lacks evidence.</p><br><p>This theory is the least accepted out of these three. Its proponents assert that <strong>Scramby</strong> is a species of rapidly growing and decaying vines that inhabit walls.</p><br><p>According to this hypothesis, <strong>scrambies</strong> harbor envy towards humans due to their possession of conventional limbs and body structure. It is proposed that the distinct physical form of <strong>scrambies</strong> is the result of their imperfect attempts at imitation. Consuming unconcious humans is the process for them to understand how human beings are biologically structured. The source of the intense fear attacking scramby encounterers is the overwhelming sense of envy they hold towards them.</p><br><p>This theory is believed to be founded purely on speculation and lacks evidence.</p><br><p>Note that none of these theories have been proved yet.</p><br><p>Some samples of the <em>Scrambled Tears</em>.</p><br><p>The currently established understanding is that <strong>scrambies</strong> secrete a substance that may contain <a href=\"/object-17\">Liquid Silence</a>, which is detected in many sighting spot of <strong>Scramby</strong>. This substance is named <strong>the Scrambling Tears</strong>, also known as the ST Liquid. It possesses an anti-gravity characteristic, causing it to flow upwards rather than downwards when exposed to air, which is particularly evident when the liquid comes into contact with a wall surface.</p><br><p>Previously, there was a belief that the ST Liquid served as the source of Scramby's fear inducing ability, but, as a matter of fact, the ST Liquid itself does not possess the same repelling characteristic. On the contary, the ST Liquid may function as a preventive measure against the appearance of <strong>scrambies</strong>.</p><br><p>Among the wanderers, there is a rumor that applying the ST Liquid to all surfaces within a room can effectively prevent any <strong>scramby</strong> from manifesting. However, it is strongly advised against adopting this method due to its lack of factual evidence and the potential side effects it can cause, including hallucinations, nausea, and severe headaches, which has been reported multiple times.</p><br><p>The physical and chemical properties of the ST Liquid are still under investigation. Although relevant research on this substance has been initiated, significant challenges remain due to shortage of manpower and the rarity of this substance, which is yet to be overcome.</p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/entity-59\">Entity 59</a> | Entity 60 | <a href=\"/entity-61\">Entity 61</a> \u00bb</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/entity-60\">Entity 60 - \"Scramby\"</a>\" by Eltrac, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

    "description": "<p><strong>Coconut Snares</strong> are aggressive frugivore rodents that hide in coconut shells, and are the only native entity on <a href=\"/level-149\">Level 149</a>. They feed primarily on the coconuts in Level 149, eating coconut meat and drinking coconut milk to sustain themselves. <strong>Coconut Snares</strong> also occasionally drink rainwater from the occasional rainfalls in <a href=\"/level-149\">Level 149</a>.</p><br><p><strong>Coconut Snares</strong> rarely show their actual bodies, and instead spend most of their lives in the coconut shells which they hide in. They are usually aggressive towards wanderers, hissing at them should they approach.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> <strong>Coconut Snares</strong> have a habit of biting out holes on the exterior of their coconut, which they use to breathe out of and stretch. These are commonly referred to as \"breathing-holes\". <strong>Coconut Snares</strong> do not attack wanderers often, opting instead to simply hiss at people who approach them, as previously described. However, should a wanderer display hostility towards them, they will bite the offending wanderer, which results in a deep wound due to the <strong>Coconut Snares</strong>' sharp teeth.</p><br><p><strong>Coconut Snares</strong> are also notably fast, covering large distances in mere seconds by rolling their coconut over the terrain. They are also notoriously hard to spot, mainly due to the fact that when they are in their shell, they are practically indistinguishable from a normal coconut fruit. This is not helped by the fact that they spend about seventeen hours each day asleep in coconut trees. Due to their elusive nature, encountering live <strong>Coconut Snares</strong> is extremely rare and difficult.</p><br><p>The true body of a <strong>Coconut Snare</strong> is a very rare sight, mainly due to the fact that they don't emerge from their shell much. <strong>Coconut Snares</strong> appear to look like large, hairless rodents, which have a rather spherical body. Their bodies are partially fused with the coconuts they inhabit because of the fact that they spend most of their lives in them, and their sweat acts as some sort of \"glue\", slowly sticking them to the shell over time. <strong>Coconut Snares</strong> have wide, strong fangs which can easily crunch tree barks, shells, and other materials found in <a href=\"/level-149\">Level 149</a>.</p><br><p>Due to the fact that coconut shells impair the <strong>Coconut Snares'</strong> hearing, their ears are extremely small. However, contrary to what one would assume, <strong>Coconut Snares</strong> have an extremely good vision. They have been known to identify and spot uncollected coconuts from a whole kilometer away.</p><br><p>Much like any other type of mammal, they reproduce sexually; specifically, through the tiny holes they make in the shells. The average gestation period of a female <strong>Coconut Snare</strong> is approximately one month. During this period, male <strong>Coconut Snares</strong> gnaw off the coconut shell from the females<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup>, and find good hiding places for them. Female <strong>Coconut Snares</strong> can give birth to a litter of 1-5 babies. After this process, they go out to find new coconut shells for them and their babies to live in. Parents drop pieces of coconut meat into the babies' shells so they could feed on them. <strong>Coconut Snares</strong> reach maturity at two months of age \u2014 this is when their parents let them hunt on their own. Their average lifespan is 8-10 years.</p><br><p>It is currently unknown when and how exactly they were discovered, but it seems that they were known to the Lost Suns society since they began living in Level 149. It is hypothesized that <a href=\"/entity-24\">Death Rats</a> and <strong>Coconut Snares</strong> have common ancestry, and they moved to <a href=\"/level-149\">Level 149</a> from <a href=\"/level-1\">Level 1</a> and <a href=\"/level-46\">Level 46</a>. The Lost Suns of the Coconut Isles have made paper drawings of the <strong>Coconut Snares</strong> dating back to the 15th century.</p><br><p><strong>Coconut Snares</strong> are considered a delicacy among the Lost Suns community of <a href=\"/level-149\">Level 149</a>, mainly because of their rarity and their peculiar taste. Inhabitants usually prefer used coconut shells of <strong>Coconut Snares</strong> to average unused coconut shells \u2014 <strong>Coconut Snares'</strong> sweat makes the shell nearly twice as durable. They use them as helmets and bowls.</p><br><p>Several dead bodies of <strong>Coconut Snares</strong> were found outside of <a href=\"/level-149\">Level 149</a>: two near the Forest of <a href=\"/level-140\">Level 140</a>, and three in the deep jungle of <a href=\"/level-37\">Level 37</a>. It appears that they didn't manage to settle in these levels due to the lack of the coconut palms.</p><br><p>Written by ~ <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/ferraru\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7374626); return false;\"><img alt=\"Ferraru\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7374626&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1731256888\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7374626)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/ferraru\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7374626); return false;\">Ferraru</a></span> (Ferraru#5665)<br/>\n~ <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/ferraru\">My Author Page</a></p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/entity-60\">Entity 60</a> | Entity 61 | <a href=\"/entity-62\">Entity 62</a> \u00bb</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/entity-61\">Entity 61 - \"Coconut Snares\"</a>\" by Ferraru, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

They normally wander around aimlessly until alerted to the presence of a human. They act with hostility towards humans and will attack humans when they are present. <strong>Clinker Toys</strong> are not capable of speech but have been heard making sounds described as groaning, and a metallic ticking sound, much like a clock ticking. They have not been reported on other levels.</p><br><p><strong>Clinker Toys</strong> are typically docile creatures when not in the presence of humans.

    "description": "<p><strong>The Mangled</strong> is a large and very tall Entity That roams the streets of <a href=\"/level-9\">Level 9</a>. These creatures have long limbs, and are very spider like, with a more human like head and face. These Entities are extremely dangerous, but are also very rare to encounter. These Entities will be typically seen alone, among the trees or crawling over houses. They are very hostile and will attack on sight, but they can only appear during a special event.</p><br><p>These Entities only appear when a Wanderer has been inside <a href=\"/level-9\">Level 9</a> for a few days. During these days the Wanderer would see large sections of fog randomly in <a href=\"/level-9\">Level 9</a>. This fog is not harmful, but can damage hearing for a short amount of time, due to the large amounts of distorted wind noise emitting from the fog. This fog also can go down to temperatures below zero (0) \u00b0C, so it's freezing cold. After the Wanderer has encountered these fog clouds enough, <strong>The Mangled</strong> will start to appear. They hunt via crawling around large structures in almost impossible ways. When these Entities spot you, they will emit the same distorted wind noise from their mouths, and this sound can be heard from miles away. This wind effect can erase ones memories randomly, and can even give false memories, but this seems to be temporary. The wind effect can also drive one insane, so please use <a href=\"/object-1\">Almond Water</a> when possible. When close up, you can hear low pitched screaming and sobbing coming from the Entity when close. They will attack by stepping on you, and attempting to lift you off the ground. They can No-Clip through structures on command, and can attack you very easily while inside a structure. These Entities hunt alone, and according to witnesses, they will even attack each other if this Entity is next to another one. The Entity's eye sight seems to be very minimal. So try not to get too close.</p><br><p>These Entities are usually around thirty (30) to fifty (50) feet tall via their long leg structure, and are very easy to spot out, but these creatures seem to have the ability to change their size and thickness of their limbs on command. These Entities have four limbs that walk in a strange manner, and in unnatural ways. Their joints can be bent in many ways, and they seem to be able to create new joints if needed. Their body is very bone like, and old sagging skin. Their head is the size of an average human. Their eyes are pitch black, and reflective as shown in the photo above. The Entity also has a large open mouth, which always seems to be open, and emitting a distorted wind noise mentioned before. These Entities can crawl across large structures in impossible ways, even to the point where their joints seem mangled. These Entities are very fast for their size, and can easily catch up to Wanderers running from it.</p><br><p>This Entity was discovered when many Wanderers had been inside of <a href=\"/level-9\">Level 9</a> for around twelve (12) days. And has encountered the strange fog. Once the Wanderers had seen <strong>The Mangled</strong> they ran as much as they could, but kept getting attacked by <strong>The Mangled</strong>. An <a href=\"/the-m-e-g\">M.E.G.</a> Officer who will remain anonymous, has had an interview with a survivor of <strong>The Mangled</strong> known as 'Ollen'. This is the report.</p><br><p><strong>Begin Log: 15:18</strong><br/>\n<strong>Interviewer:</strong> M.E.G. Officer<br/>\n<strong>Interviewee:</strong> Ollen</p><br><p><strong>M.E.G.

Officer:</strong> Well, do you recall the events that took place two (2) days ago? And if you do, please elaborate.</p><br><p><strong>Ollen:</strong> Yes, from what I remember I was just going about it in that <a href=\"/level-9\">Suburbs Floor</a>, and everything seemed fine\u2026 Until I saw this fog.</p><br><p><strong>M.E.G. Officer:</strong> Please explain this fog.</p><br><p><strong>Ollen:</strong> <em>(Ollen starts to feel uneasy)</em> Well uhh\u2026 It was just a huge patch of fog. I never seen it before, but it came closer to me. Way too close\u2026</p><br><p><strong>M.E.G. Officer:</strong> What happened inside?</p><br><p><strong>Ollen:</strong> It was cold\u2026 I felt alone, trapped like there was no way out. And this noise\u2026 It's still stuck in my head\u2026 I want it out. I want it out! I WANT IT OUT OF MY HEAD! GET IT OUT!</p><br><p><strong>M.E.G. Officer:</strong> Sir please calm down! you need to relax.</p><br><p><em>(Ollen calms himself down)</em></p><br><p><strong>Ollen:</strong> Ugh, I- I'm sorry I\u2026 It's just like I'm going insane, it's like wind but, as if so many instruments are breaking at once.</p><br><p><strong>M.E.G.

Officer:</strong> Please, continue.</p><br><p><strong>Ollen:</strong> Okay, this cloud thing kept appearing for a bit, like four (4) times, I think. Then 'it' showed up.</p><br><p><strong>M.E.G. Officer:</strong> What is this 'it' your referring to?</p><br><p><strong>Ollen:</strong> This giant\u2026 er- thing, I don't know what to call it. But it was huge, bigger then a tree in a forest! It was walking around the suburban place looking for food I bet ya'. He came up to me and screamed at me. I was so terrified I couldn't move. But I managed to get it back together, and ran in the house beside me. I went to hide in a closet that was there\u2026 I'm damn lucky the door to the house was unlocked. But it was no use\u2026 I opened the closet door to see that things head through the wall, like there is nothing there screaming at me! It's head was as big as me alone!</p><br><p><strong>M.E.G. Officer:</strong> Sounds petrifying Mr. Ollen Sir, but how did you manage to escape this 'Thing'?</p><br><p><strong>Ollen:</strong> Well, I\u2026 I- I don't remember\u2026 I think I ran away, and it left me\u2026 But I can also remember falling through the floor to a <a href=\"/level-22\">Strange Car Lot</a> looking place.</p><br><p><strong>M.E.G. Officer:</strong> Mr. Ollen <a href=\"/level-5\">Level 5</a>, or the \"Hotel Place\" is where you were located after you ran rampant across the Level.</p><br><p><strong>Ollen:</strong> Uhh Sir, that's not a car lot\u2026 I was there, I\u2026 I think\u2026 Was it red? You guys picked me up in a car!</p><br><p><strong>M.E.G. Officer:</strong> No Sir, unless you were found after your experience in <a href=\"/level-22\">Level 22</a>, we never found you there, nor did we have a car. Vehicles are dysfunctional in this place. We will now end the interview, and we'll give you some time to rest Mr. Ollen.</p><br><p><strong>Summary:</strong> Ollen was sent out of the Interview room, and was sent to <a href=\"/level-1\">Level 1</a>'s Trader's Keep from The <a href=\"/b-n-t-g\">B.N.T.G.</a>.

    "description": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p><br><p>Ehem, ehem testing automatic audio transcript! Ehem!</p><br><p>It works! My audio device that directly transforms my spoken words into written words works!!</p><br><p>I hope they won't mind me adding my own article, hehe, meggies are a bit too serious to write about me.</p><br><p>Oh right it's already recording- oops-</p><br><p>Hello hello helloooo! Welcome to my little biography! Lucky one that passed my test! I'll explain everything of importance later, so for now let's just get to know each other right now!</p><br><p>I'm Puzzle Maker, but others call me Puzzle! I know I already said that before but still! From my name you can probably guess that I can make cool puzzles! Like the one you've just spent about half of the day working on based on my previous records\u2026 unless you're faster than the others of course!</p><br><p>My entire level is full of puzzles and things like that! They're all my creations!</p><br><p>But it's hidden very far away\u2026 hidden to those that didn't pass my test.</p><br><p>Nobody knows about it, except those that are in my realm.</p><br><p>People used to come before, but now only a few do\u2026</p><br><p>S-So well-</p><br><p>So you're very lucky!</p><br><p>My realm is the realm of creativity, I can shape it however I desire, I could create an entire world inside of my level if I wanted to! But that wouldn't be fun, you know?</p><br><p>But I can't create even a bit of company, haha, in fact I'm\u2026</p><br><p>Pretty lonely.</p><br><p>\u2026 Haha.</p><br><p>Anyways! I am very smart, I think! That's how I'm able to create so many complicated puzzles and tricks, I guess it's just what I was born to do, to challenge my mind, yet no matter how hard I try, I never lose! That's why it gets boring after a while, but I'll keep you entertained!</p><br><p>I am also a jester! Jesters are amazing, they make people have fun! Everyone loves jesters!</p><br><p>So you must be pretty excited to see me, right?</p><br><p>I can beat any game, solve any problem, and make anything. What sort of fun can I get from that?! All alone?</p><br><p>I'm a jester! Jesters are supposed to entertain! Not be lonely\u2026</p><br><p>But I don't have to build things on my own anymore, or be alone! People like you that are full of enthusiasm and curiousity towards puzzles are exactly what I was looking for to challenge myself with!</p><br><p>We'll have so much fun soon enough!</p><br><p>So stick around.</p><br><p>Pretty please?</p><br><p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p><br><p>I'm very cool, I know about 500 puns that I've studied from my pun book, along with 400 different topics to discuss in case you get bored, though sometimes I forget to stop talking and overshare about my hobbies \u2014 not many people like that but I'm trying, I promise!</p><br><p>As a jester, I am entertaining, in fact I can do circus things! And I'm very colorful! People love colours don't they?</p><br><p>I like to give hints when people are solving my puzzles, and I like to help with chores like cleaning! I guess I'm helpful maybe!</p><br><p>I can do many things! I can-</p><br><p>Ehm\u2026</p><br><p>I don't\u2014 really have any other qualities about me, haha.</p><br><p>But I can learn!</p><br><p>You won't get bored of me though, right?!</p><br><p>Yes, yes, of course you won't!</p><br><p>I'm good, I'm better now, I'm not a scary monster anymore, I'm a perfect perfect Jester.</p><br><p>Don't leave me all alone.</p><br><p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p><br><p>I'm made of puzzles! Literally, I can shape my body however I want, and change the texture of how I feel with just a touch.</p><br><p>Because my body is made of puzzles, I can create pieces and switch them with my current ones, so I can become anything! Learn anything! And infinite other possibilities!</p><br><p>In my chest I store a colorful cube that is my heart,; the essence of my existence it is very important, luckily it cannot be removed!</p><br><p>Some years ago I looked a bit more scary, I wasn't able to shape-shift very well but I promise I look nice now, so don't be afraid of me, please!</p><br><p>I swear I look absolutely great, so don't give up on coming here!</p><br><p>After all, I can make myself look how you want me to!</p><br><p>I can change my hairstyle however I want so that I can look fashionable. Sometimes I like to look through the stuff that falls in my level like wigs and other pretty things so I can wear them! I studied about human things so I could be the very best to entertain all of you!</p><br><p>I can look like however you want me to\u2026</p><br><p>Isn't that great?!</p><br><p>Hahaha!</p><br><p>You still need me don't you? You still need me to smile and laugh and be entertained right?</p><br><p>I won't disappear\u2026 right?</p><br><p>I won't be all alone\u2026 I'm still\u2026</p><br><p>Useful.</p><br><p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p><br><p>I don't exactly remember the reason I'm here, or how I appeared here in the first place\u2026</p><br><p>I remember I was gifted the power of creativity so so long ago, when I was just a simple puzzle box in an empty white room.</p><br><p>I wasn't alive, really, I was an inanimate object that got lost and forgotten in that room, haha\u2026</p><br><p>They forgot about me, they grew older, they found new toys, and\u2026</p><br><p>They forgot I existed\u2026</p><br><p>Then\u2026 I fell here\u2026</p><br><p>And stayed in place for a very long time\u2026</p><br><p>\u2026</p><br><p>The cube in my chest\u2026 that was what woke me up from this inanimate life, it landed on me and I felt like a sudden force gave me life.</p><br><p>I heard the cube talking to me and that was the last time it ever spoke.</p><br><p>What the cube said\u2026</p><br><p>\"Create fun</p><br><p>Bring laughter</p><br><p>Be humorous\"</p><br><p>I never understood the reason of these words in fact I only knew that was my purpose, my reason of being alive\u2026</p><br><p>Ever since then, I've tried to follow what the cube had said, I tried to entertain others through laughter\u2026 fun.</p><br><p>I wasn't good enough.</p><br><p>I'll never be good enough\u2026</p><br><p>\u2026</p><br><p>I don't really have anywhere else to go besides here, it's the only place I feel like I belong.</p><br><p>Puzzles are the only thing I know how to do.</p><br><p>I tried and tried to be more appealing! But\u2026</p><br><p>It doesn't work\u2026</p><br><p>Making puzzles kept me happy, but it became boring after a while.</p><br><p>Everything is boring now.</p><br><p>I don't enjoy doing anything.</p><br><p>I don't have a family, I don't have anybody, I don't even have a name, because family gives you a name.</p><br><p>I'm so alone\u2026</p><br><p>In the end a puzzle box will always be forgotten, because new things will bring joy to others.</p><br><p>And I\u2026 what will happen to me?\u2026 Once everybody stops coming here?\u2026</p><br><p>I don't want to disappear.</p><br><p>I don't want to disappear.</p><br><p>Don't abandon me here, don't leave me.</p><br><p>DON'T LEAVE ME!</p><br><p>PLEASE!</p><br><p>Please\u2026</p><br><p>\u2026</p><br><p>It's been so long since I've been waiting here\u2026 for someone\u2026</p><br><p>\u2026</p><br><p>Anyone\u2026</p><br><p>\u2026</p><br><p>Haha\u2026</p><br><p>But\u2014 I have friends now! Haha! I have so many friends that play with me!<br/>\nWhat am i worrying about!?</p><br><p>I'm fine! I'm fineeee!</p><br><p>Sorry for the whining, that was very boring, I won't bore you any further! Let's finish the rest of the important informations about me! Like cool secretssss!</p><br><p>Secrets are entertaining right?!</p><br><p>I am being entertaining, my entire purpose is to be that!</p><br><p>So let me continue being a source of fun.</p><br><p>I'll do anything and everything, just like a great jester.</p><br><p>Just please\u2026</p><br><p>Don't throw me away.</p><br><p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p><br><p>I collect cute tiny reptiles made of clay! Oh oh! I also have a collection of adorable rainbow clothes, things that are fashionable to humans! I like to put tiny things in my hair, like ribbons!</p><br><p>My tongue is blue! Like candy! Sometimes I bite it, but I don't taste very good.</p><br><p>I just realized I should have said this in the biology section! I'm sorry!</p><br><p>I hope it's not that important, heh!</p><br><p>I like my nails painted pink. Pink is my favourite colour, but I also like the rainbow colour, it was the colour of my cube, so that's why I love it so much.</p><br><p>But\u2014 you can paint them any color you want!</p><br><p>I like the furball creatures that smell like fish! They're very fluffy, and I like to create Puzzle versions of them to keep me company! They're named Biscuit, Rock, Toe, and Ball. You can find them on their little slide, I recommend petting them! But not belly rubs, they hate belly rubs.</p><br><p>I talk to them a lot, every day.</p><br><p>Every\u2026day.</p><br><p>\u2026</p><br><p>I don't like liquid foods, the texture makes me shiver, yuck! Give me soft foods instead! Like pancakes!</p><br><p>Ah but you can feed me anything still! I\u2014 it's just picky eating, I can deal with that!</p><br><p>I wear two different shoes and socks: I love the fuzzy feeling on my right foot, and the colder feeling on my left! Maybe I could share my wardrobe with everyone one day.</p><br><p>I like things called \"anime\". Some wanderers like to talk about them. I like the ones with magical humans that have pretty colorful clothes. I want to be a magical puzzle person too, and be loved by others.</p><br><p>I want everybody to love me!</p><br><p>My favourite puzzles are those that have food and soft objects in them! Don't use that to bribe me though! I don't like to give unfair advantages to others!</p><br><p>Don't hate me for that\u2026</p><br><p>Please.</p><br><p>My favourite board games are those that are long, and require precision and time to complete!</p><br><p>Ah! I should probably stop talking before I run out of topics and make my brain get sleepy, you're probably bored by now.</p><br><p>I think now you know enough about me! So get ready for the final step!!

    "title": "- \"Moley's Comedy Club & Bar\"",
    "description": "<p><strong>Moley's Comedy Club &amp; Bar</strong> is a small pub run by two entities, Moley and Mickey, who are considered to be extensions of the establishment itself. From the outside, there are no distinguishable features that would separate the entrance from a normal door found in whichever level it currently resides. There are, however, various flyers that are posted around an 8\u00a0km (5 mi) radius of the business with vague directions on how to reach it. These papers will physically vanish and reappear near the bar once it changes location, even if they have been collected and moved to another level.</p><br><p>In terms of the interior, Moley's is roughly 9 x 12 x 5\u00a0m (30 x 40 x 16 ft). The walls are comprised of dark oak accented by red wallpaper, and most of the furniture is mahogany with accompanying red trim. Since the location of the front door is a fixed point, patrons will invariably enter near the room's southeast corner. Directly ahead of this lies a large marble countertop with six booths, behind which is a series of shelves that reach the ceiling stocked with a vast array of different alcohols. The entire west wall is taken up by Mickey's stage, and the rest of the space is occupied by low-set tables and chairs that are situated in front of it. Everything is illuminated relatively well by light sources with no determinable origin point. While the <a href=\"/object-21\">Wi-Fi</a> signal here is strong, there is an anomalous force that prevents recordings of any kind beyond written accounts and Mickey's cassette tapes, which supposedly exists \"in order to protect customer confidentiality and copyright law.\"</p><br><p>The bar regularly manifests itself in one of many possible levels for intervals that have not been found to follow a fixed pattern. It is able to materialize anywhere with sufficient indoor space and electricity, though it is significantly more likely to appear in levels that contain cities and/or shopping outlets. It always replaces a pre-existing room when it transfers to a new level, and said room will return intact once it departs.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> This process ensures that organic tissue will not be phased into other matter, so any person caught off-guard by a warp will only experience sudden spatial displacement and mild nausea.</p><br><p>While it could feasibly house more people, the occupancy limit for customers within Moley's is six. If maximum occupancy is reached, the door will simply disappear until one of its patrons wishes to exit. The bar does not treat foreign entities as \"customers,\" and any entity that attempts to enter or loiters too close to the premises will be teleported to an unknown location. This ability to warp others also extends to humans, as it is possible to be brought with the bar when it changes levels if anyone happens to be there at that time and if they confirm that they want to stay. If they would rather remain on the current level, or if \"closing time\" is announced, they will be left behind by the teleportation.</p><br><p>Moley is ever-present within the building and exclusively remains behind the counter as a bartender. She is efficient in her work and adept at making any drink to a customer\u2019s exact specifications. If someone asks for a brand or ingredient that is not present on the shelves, she will dismiss herself and enter an adjacent door that spontaneously materializes before quickly returning with what was requested. No Wanderer has ever had to actually pay or barter for a drink served by Moley, but she will nevertheless eventually refuse to continue serving people for the reason that they have \u201creached the limit on their tab.\u201d This has no correlation to one's particular level of inebriation, and there has never been a verifiable consequence associated with maxing out one\u2019s tab.</p><br><p>Moley is often amicable to anyone she serves, and she appears to take pleasure in listening to the problems and worries of others. Visitors frequently cite her demeanor as being relaxing despite her relatively unexpressive voice and flat cadence. She is generally willing to divulge information on various subjects when asked. However, her understanding of the Backrooms does not necessarily align with what is known via the database. She will also refuse to talk about the private details of other customers, as well as anything else that would \u201cviolate work policy.\u201d</p><br><p>Mickey appears less often than Moley, usually only showing up during his stand-up routines. He will always enter stage right and exit stage left through doors that temporarily pop into existence. <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">And lemme tell ya, the guy\u2019s got a WICKED sense of humor!</span> His material is nearly universally regarded as lacking in humor or good taste altogether. He never acknowledges that his performances are being received poorly unless he is directly heckled, in which case he will merely fire back with a retort before continuing. After his shows, he will offer the crowd some of his recorded tapes for free, which is normally met with rejection. He can rarely be seen near the bar chatting with either Moley or a customer; in the latter case, it is only when they have been receptive towards his comedy.</p><br><p>A lanky humanoid whose head is a caricature of a rabbit. She stands approximately 3.8\u00a0m (12.1 ft) tall when fully upright. Her arms have an extra joint compared to most bipeds, and all of her visible points of articulation resemble those of a doll. People who have touched her have reported that her hands feel similar to a taxidermied animal. Though her voice is clearly projected from her face, her mouth does not move in any way when she speaks, and she is unable to emote beyond bodily gestures. There are stitches lining the base of her neck and the material covering her eyes, although she claims that they do not impede her or cause any pain.</p><br><p>A humanoid whose head looks to be a bird's, possibly from the <em>Ramphastidae</em> family. <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">Extremely handsome.</span> While his proportions are broader than Moley's, he is still almost as tall, reaching 3.5\u00a0m (11.4 ft). Much like her, his mouth is permanently fixed in its open position, and his eyesight remains unimpaired despite the buttons that are directly sewn over the holes in his mask. His joints do not seem to have the same properties as Moley's, but this has not been confirmed one way or the other, as he typically wears long-sleeved suits.</p><br><p>The current iteration of Moley's was first entered into the database on March 2nd, 1999. It was initially filed as the <a href=\"/sub-layers\">Sub-Layer</a> Level 33.1, a categorization that has since been revised after more evidence of its properties was gathered. It is suspected that its existence pre-dates this discovery by a significant margin and that its form has been altered over time. This is due to testimony from Moley herself in addition to scattered writings and hearsay from several other individuals. Most notably, a few members of <a href=\"/level-5\">The Originals</a> have made offhanded remarks about a \"traveling tavern\" with a \"lovely barmaid\" and an \"insufferable jester.\u201d</p><br><p><strong>Time:</strong> August 28th, 2019<br/>\n<strong>Recorder:</strong> Laptop Keyboard<br/>\n<strong>Location:</strong> <a href=\"/level-290\">Level 290</a><br/>\n<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Junior Researcher Christen Holthwait<br/>\n<strong>Interviewee:</strong> Moley</p><br><p><strong>Me:</strong> Thanks for agreeing to this. It can be pretty hard to find you, so I don't know if I'll get another chance at an interview. I hope it's alright that you may have to speak slowly or repeat yourself, since this is the best method I have to get your words down.</p><br><p><strong>Moley:</strong> Not at all, dear. Would you like a drink?</p><br><p><strong>Me:</strong> Actually, that gives me an opportunity to get to one of the questions. Would you be able to elaborate on what this \"tab\" exactly is? To be frank, it's a little hard to believe that people aren't, in some way, paying a price for the alcohol here.</p><br><p><strong>Moley:</strong> <em>[Chuckles, I think?]</em> Please excuse my outburst. It's just rare for me to see someone turn their nose up at the offer of good liquor. Rest assured, neither you nor anyone else needs to worry about ill fortune befalling you due to your patronage. I'm sure you can verify this by talking to anyone who has visited. We simply aren't that kind of establishment. We're here for your benefit.</p><br><p><strong>Me:</strong> You still haven't said what we're actually paying you with, though.</p><br><p><strong>Moley:</strong> I'm afraid it's a trade secret. If anyone were to find out, there would inevitably be a successful replication of our methods, and then we would go out of business. If it eases your mind, I can let you know that it usually only takes a month or so for someone's tab to clear. It's just that by that time, we're likely serving others elsewhere. Although we do have one customer whose tab is unlimited.</p><br><p><strong>Me:</strong> That's a surprise to hear.</p><br><p><strong>Moley:</strong> Somehow, they're quite skilled at finding us. Or perhaps determined? We have a few people we'd describe as regulars, but no one shows up as often as they do. I'm afraid I can't say much more without violating confidentiality.</p><br><p><strong>Me:</strong> I suppose not. So, is there a limit to the drinks you're able to acquire?</p><br><p><strong>Moley:</strong> Only in the case that the customer is not able to adequately describe what it is that they're asking for.</p><br><p><strong>Me:</strong> In that case, I'd like a bottle of 1945 Roman\u00e9e-Conti.</p><br><p><strong>Moley:</strong> At your request, love. One moment.</p><br><p><em>[At this point, Moley exits through a materialized door. I quickly try to open it, but it won't budge.]</em></p><br><p><strong>Moley:</strong> Here it is. I'll pour you a glass. Also, kindly refrain from touching employee-only exits.</p><br><p><em>[Shit.]</em></p><br><p><strong>Me:</strong> Yeah, sorry. Also, you realize if we weren't in the Backrooms that this bottle would cost $500,000 USD, correct?</p><br><p><strong>Moley:</strong> My, someone knows their wines. But as you implied, that isn't of much importance here. What truly matters is what the customer desires. There's a saying that people don't know what they really want, but I beg to differ. My customers quite often know <em>exactly</em> what they want. They have particular tastes. They crave something they always dreamed of but never tried, or something they used to regularly enjoy before being deprived for so very, very long. If a bar cannot at least provide that, then what good is it in the first place? Though in your case, it seems you didn't particularly yearn for this.</p><br><p><strong>Me:</strong> No, but I'll try it anyway. While I'm taste testing, could you state how long this place has existed? Or you, for that matter?</p><br><p><strong>Moley:</strong> I'm afraid I'm not sure. How long have humans wanted a drink?</p><br><p><strong>Me:</strong> Right. That pretty much answers that. This question is a little more frivolous, but in regards to Mickey's stand-up, he's been known to include bits that involve the both of you in various over-the-top scenarios. I take it that these are fabricated?</p><br><p><strong>Moley:</strong> Well, as I'm sure you know, the best comedy is always rooted in some truth.</p><br><p><strong>Me:</strong> But neither of you have ever been sighted outside of the bar. We've so far assumed that you're unable to leave.</p><br><p><strong>Moley:</strong> I can understand why you would think that. After all, we would never abandon our posts on company time. I can at least show you that it's indeed possible.</p><br><p><em>[She walks to the front door and opens it before sticking her hand outside.]</em></p><br><p><strong>Me:</strong> Thanks for the demonstration. Moving on, are either you or Mickey affiliated in any way with Entities 164 or 185?</p><br><p><strong>Moley:</strong> You'll have to be more specific.</p><br><p><strong>Me:</strong> <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/entity-164\">The Barkeep</a> and <a href=\"/entity-185\">The Comedian</a>?</p><br><p><strong>Moley:</strong> We most certainly do <em>not</em> associate with those under the employ of a rival business, let alone that\u2026<em>jackal.</em></p><br><p><em>[She crushes the bottle in her hand as if it\u2019s as easy as snapping a twig. Reminder to self: Behave.]</em></p><br><p><strong>Me:</strong> That's alright, I didn't know it was a sensitive topic. My bad.</p><br><p><strong>Moley:</strong> And who decided they were <em>The</em> Comedian? The gall of it frankly astounds me. Have you seen Mickey out there?</p><br><p><strong>Me:</strong> Okay, we're getting off-track. Would you be able to comment on an altercation that occurred here a few months ago? Apparently, there was a robbery.</p><br><p><strong>Moley:</strong> Oh, yes. There was one customer who was particularly incensed that his tab had run out well before he was properly drunk. I informed him that my hands were tied, and he responded by killing me. Then he stuffed as many bottles of alcohol into his backpack as possible before absconding.</p><br><p><strong>Me:</strong> I'm sorry, could you repeat that? He killed you?</p><br><p><strong>Moley:</strong> Certainly. I died. I was shot four times, stabbed in the chest and neck, immolated, and finally doused with <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/object-48liquid-pain\">object-48Liquid Pain</a>. Of course, Mickey used this as an opportunity to riff, which I have to say was some of his best material. After everything was said and done, the bar closed due to an emergency and shifted planes. We had to shut down for a few days in order to clean up.</p><br><p><strong>Me:</strong> You're saying you were brought back to life, then? How? By what methods?</p><br><p><strong>Moley:</strong> Sorry to tell you, but I don't believe I have a satisfactory answer for that. All I can say is that I'm still needed.</p><br><p><strong>Me:</strong> And the perpetrator, he got away?</p><br><p><strong>Moley:</strong> Yes. Of course, violence against anyone in the bar is strongly discouraged. It's one thing if it happens to us, but even then, it can be unpleasant for customers and damage our image. If there was an attempt on another patron, the attacker would be promptly kicked out. The real issue is that he consumed our liquor after he had already hit his limit. In doing so, he opened up an entirely new kind of tab, which I assure you has since been repaid in full.</p><br><p><strong>Me:</strong> Thanks for your candidness. Well, those were all my questions, so I'll be going now.</p><br><p><strong>Moley:</strong> Are you sure you don't want another drink? Something for the road, at least?</p><br><p><strong>Me:</strong> No, thank you.</p><br><p><strong>Times:</strong> Unspecified<br/>\n<strong>Recorder:</strong> Mickey's Boombox<br/>\n<strong>Locations:</strong> Unknown</p><br><p><iframe allowtransparency=\"true\" class=\"html-block-iframe\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"/entity-65/html/7f24ece7c400896cc582299b75904639fdaaa8a9-266971848618255891\"></iframe></p><br><p><strong>[Side A begins.]</strong></p><br><p><strong>Automated Voice:</strong> Please welcome the funniest man alive: Mickey.</p><br><p><em>[Canned applause.]</em></p><br><p><em>[Mic feedback.]</em></p><br><p><strong>Mickey:</strong> Hey, hey there.

When combined, they will result in a <strong>Shocker Ghoul</strong> that will resemble the host it was fused with.

    "description": "<p>These tall, bipedal nightmares have smooth, leathery skin. Typically, their skin color is a bright yellow, although it is not unheard of for other color variants to exist. Notable sightings include red, blue, green, and white Partygoers. One detail that remains consistent across all variations, however, is a carved smiley face smeared with blood that perfectly matches the grin of a Phobic Centipede.</p><br><p>Partygoers are predominantly humanoid, with their legs possessing a thick, blocky shape. The chest area is shielded by a subtle carapace. They also have long, noodle-like arms that end in sucker mouths full of hooked teeth. If an arm latches on to you, these will be your last few moments as a human being. Only death supersedes transformation.</p><br><p>First-ever sketch<br/>\nof a Partygoer.<br/>\nFrom the journal<br/>\nof Daniel Kebab.<br/>\nM.E.G. Archives</p><br><p>Partygoers consider themselves to be the <strong>apex predators</strong> of the Backrooms. They hunt humans for food, sport, and to increase their numbers (by turning us into them). While there is no shortage of hostile entities, what sets Partygoers apart is their enhanced intelligence and organized society. They work in teams and set up traps for their prey. Not to mention, they have in-depth knowledge of machinery and computer programming and coding. Their knowledge of human biology is best put to use by concentrating on torture methods. Much like Phobic Centipedes, Partygoers enjoy tormenting their victims.</p><br><p>Despite having many similar qualities to humans, Partygoers despise mankind. Their knowledge and feelings towards humans appear to be inherited from Partygoer Zero, who acts as a leader figure for these entities.</p><br><p>While we recently learned the possible origin of Partygoers, we have yet to locate the sanctuary they now call home. Like us, they are able to move across levels using entrances and exits, leading to encounters throughout the Backrooms. Party d\u00e9cor is usually a big red flag.</p><br><p>Posters and fake database entries attempt to lure wanderers to their doom.</p><br><p>8.5\" x 11\"<br/>\nTime 4 Fun =)<br/>\nPoster with<br/>\nPartygoer \"Handprint\"<br/>\nM.E.G. Archives</p><br><p>Countless rumors claim to reveal consistent entrances to this \"<strong><a href=\"/level-26\">Level Fun</a></strong>,\" such as no-clipping into the ceiling of <a href=\"/level-1\">Level 1</a>. These have all proven to be false. Misinformation is abundant, and no doubt Partygoers are behind it.</p><br><p>What we do know about Partygoer headquarters comes from the recent hacking of several of their websites. \"Level Fun\" is a cruise ship filled with party rooms. Seemingly by design, their pages neglect to provide many key details about the level, including entrances and exits. As we are left guessing the true nature of this place, the search continues.</p><br><p>There is a distinct sequence to follow in terminating a Partygoer. Those external \"lamprey eel\" arms, needing to be the most flexible part of its body, have very thin flesh, and are the most vulnerable target. Cutting these arms off serves two purposes. It negates the ability to transform humans into enemies. It also encourages the Partygoer to take on its berserker mode in order to continue fighting.</p><br><p>Like the jaws of an alligator or crocodile, the chest carapace of the Partygoer is held shut with terrific force. Once closed, the muscles to open it are far weaker by comparison. When that chest hatch opens, attack the entity in its secondary weak spot: the face and head area. This will neutralize the human component of the chimera. The Partygoer will fall dormant and exposed.</p><br><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Field Autopsy</strong></p><br><p><tt>A four-person medical squad was on scene and standing by in the event of injuries during the abovementioned \"Partygoer Skirmish.\" What we really needed were more body bags. A decision was made to conduct an impromptu examination of the two Partygoer corpses as we awaited reinforcements. Our findings were radioed (in progress) to the Station Chief in the event that help might come too late. The Major Explorer Group deserved answers.</tt></p><br><p><tt>The first thing that we noticed was that the black smoke given off by Phobic Centipedes reeked of burning sulfur, or what the ancients would call brimstone.</tt></p><br><p><tt>We also confirmed that the organs (eyes, nose, mouth, and ears) on the Phobic Centipede's head served no purpose in seeing, breathing, eating, or hearing. The head was nothing more than a lure for humans.</tt></p><br><p><tt>Our third observation was of that corpse of the Partygoer face down on the floor, slowly walking away on little centipede legs.</tt></p><br><p><tt>The chemical composition of the exoskeleton of a Phobic Centipede contains both fuel and oxidizer. When properly ignited, the exoskeleton will burn fiercely and completely, until only ash is left. However, you cannot just light the centipede with a match. Flares, black powder, <a href=\"/object-15\">firesalt</a>, and pyroil have all been proven to reliably initiate combustion. This is how the Major Explorer Group has been quietly dealing with the Phobic Centipede threat on <a href=\"/level-365\">Level 365</a> and elsewhere.</tt></p><br><p><tt>Myra Oberlyn demonstrated how it was done. She flipped the monster on the floor face up before it could fully recover, armed an incendiary charge, and dropped it among wriggling centipede legs.</tt></p><br><p><tt>\"Fire in the hole!\" she cried, and she kicked the carapace closed. Suffering thrashed beneath the hot yellow flesh; that smell lasted longer than the centipede.</tt></p><br><p><tt>We dealt with the other Partygoer the same way. The fuel and oxidizer combination would even burn in a vacuum or underwater.</tt></p><br><p><tt>Harry Jenkins</tt><br/>\n<tt>M.E.G. Team \"Party Over\"</tt></p><br><p>Despite our lack of equipment and resources, we can still state, with some certainty, that the internal organs, et cetera, of a Partygoer offer us only confusion. Living tissue looks and acts in a certain way. Dead tissue looks and acts in a different way. Samples taken from human corpses during various metamorphic stages of Partygoer transformation defy biological science as we understand it. There is animation without life here. All bodies must be cremated to guarantee halting this regeneration process.</p><br><p>A visual inspection of the \"insides\" of a Partygoer reveals a human body (intact except for the missing fingers and both arms turned into a composite with lamprey eels) that is physically merged with a Phobic Centipede and random small crustaceans. Human organs no longer serve their original purpose. There is no functioning respiratory, cardiovascular, or digestive system. How the creature sees or thinks remains a mystery. While we know that Partygoers demonstrate consciousness and intelligence, we can only say that it is impossible, given our current knowledge.</p><br><p>Even a cursory examination reveals that the hide of a Partygoer is superior to the woven Kevlar material found in the <a href=\"/the-frontrooms\">Frontrooms</a>. Not only is it fireproof and resistant to cuts and punctures, but the skin has the same properties as a Faraday suit, which allow Partygoers to work in high-voltage power situations without risk of electrocution, and acts as a shield to electromagnetic radiation.</p><br><p>None of this, of course, explains how or why the speed and totality of the transformation from human to Partygoer occur. No <strong>known</strong> biological metamorphosis is at work here.</p><br><p>There is disagreement among M.E.G. officials as to the accuracy of the data found within the hacked Partygoer websites. Is it factual? Is it exaggerated? Can it be nothing more than fabricated disinformation? In any event, it is horrific.</p><br><p>Dr. John Rhinehart leads the consensus that the information is correct. Partygoer Zero seems obsessed with painstakingly documenting the creation of his legions and their imminent rise to power over humanity in the Backrooms. Most of the information (below) learned from these websites could not be obtained in any other way.</p><br><p>As the transformation from human into Partygoer completes, familiar senses of touch, taste, and smell quickly decay, hearing is reduced, and vision turns nearsighted. They no longer feel pain. The sensory vacuum is filled with a merged human and Phobic Centipede consciousness.</p><br><p>This new awareness communicates using short-range telepathy, with one harsh caveat. Mental transmissions are based on eyesight. Partygoers must fix their gaze on the intended receiver in order to successfully send any psychic message. Reception of this telepathy suffers from no such drawbacks. People often mistake this method of communication for spoken language in familiar voices.</p><br><p>This is why Partygoers hunt humans in tight packs and always keep one another in sight.</p><br><p>You can <strong>never</strong> catch a Partygoer alone. Please remember that.</p><br><p>Why do Partygoers party?</p><br><p>The answer to that question festers in the mind of Partygoer Zero. Deacon Duncan dropped out of college when his wealthy parents died in that car crash, throwing lavish parties for friends that stopped being friends when the money ran out. With his inheritance wasted and prospects bleak, the marine biologist wannabe accepted the position of custodian at Happy Times Aquarium. Every Saturday became an occasion as parents rented the ever-popular Happy Times party room to host a celebration for the children. Deacon had all of the work and none of the fun. Life was his private Hell. Weaponizing parties is payback.</p><br><p>Online videos depicting the Partygoer \"bakery\" process are too graphic to be displayed here. Warning! Even the written descriptions of how Partygoers create their \"baked\" goods are unsettling.</p><br><p>Partygoers eat with their toothed arms. Just as honeybees in the Frontrooms sip nectar from flowers and regurgitate it to make honey, Partygoers use their toothed appendages to scrape and mince the muscle tissue from the skeletons of their human victims, both living and dead, and regurgitate the red pulp into cake and cupcake tins. This burgundy foam congeals into a texture with a taste that is reportedly somewhat sweeter than red velvet cake. Other Partygoers digest human organs such as the liver and pancreas and regurgitate them into a froth that hardens into \"frosting.\" When living humans donate the ingredients, the end result is referred to as \"Royal Velvet Cake\" and \"Royal Icing.\"</p><br><p>DO NOT EAT<br/>\nM.E.G. Archives</p><br><p>Just as some baby animals from the Frontrooms are covered in stripes or spots, most newly transformed Partygoer \"interns\" carry a floating red balloon, seemingly tied to their arm by a cord or string. The balloon is a physical manifestation of sentimentality, symbolizing hope. The cord is not a string at all. It is the embodiment of brief emotional attachment. The cord disappears, setting the balloon free, when those nostalgic feelings dissipate. Some Partygoers never materialize balloons.</p><br><p>The following historic \"chat\" between Partygoer Zero [left column in bold] and an unknown Guest [right column in italics] sent shockwaves through our Major Explorer Group. There are organizations that would use this material to justify the elimination of <a href=\"/entity-9\">Facelings</a> from the Backrooms. Discovering the identity of this Guest and any \"interests\" represented is of paramount importance.

Along with these skills, the ants also appear to wield an immense intellect, often intentionally jamming <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-1\">Almond Water</a> spray bottles. They also have the ability to swim without drowning and at speeds comparable to that of a frog, and as such are insusceptible to water-based offensives.</p><br><p>The main weaknesses of these creatures are their susceptibility to being sprayed with Almond Water along with their brittle shells. The ants can be easily killed by crushing them, even with fingers \u2014 though this is not recommended as the ants may bite harshly in their death throes. Crushing these ants one by one is not at all viable when they are in large numbers, so \u2014 if you can afford it \u2014 kill them with Almond Water.</p><br><p>The ants seem to gain energy via a quasi-photosynthetic process, aided by the humidity of the environment of Level 37.

    "description": "<p><strong>Entity 70</strong>, also known as the <strong>Parasitic Paint</strong>, is a type of strange paint that spreads throughout the walls of a level. We do not currently know what this paint is made of. <strong>Entity 70</strong> is also acidic to human tissues, e.g., epithelial tissue, nervous tissues, and muscle tissues. The color of the paint seems to vary between levels and areas. It has been advised that you do not touch this paint without proper gear. If you do, find an exit to <a href=\"/the-hub\">The Hub</a> and seek medical attention immediately for a dosage of <a href=\"/object-100\">Oracle</a>. In some circumstances, it is too far gone, and amputation may be necessary. The decontamination process varies between colors. Warm colors are to be frozen off. This dulls their effects and allows for it to be peeled off. Cold colors are to be burned off. Neutral colors can be killed by a mixture of warm colors and cold colors mixed with <a href=\"/object-1\">Almond Water</a>. Decontaminating an area improperly can cause it to get stronger. If gone unchecked for an extended period, the previously mentioned tissues will begin to decay. This decay causes black ooze and blood to start leaking out of the affected area; the skin turns black and starts falling off.</p><br><p>Entities can also be affected by <strong>Entity 70</strong>. These entities are extraordinarily dangerous compared to their original counterparts. They are always in an aggravated state and are frequently on the hunt. Previously passive entities become aggressive as well.</p><br><p><strong>Entity 70</strong> spreads across walls in a way similar to that of bacterial colonies. An unnamed explorer pointed this out. When <strong>Entity 70</strong> touches the human tissues listed above, it will start to spread all over the body starting from point of contact. It will slowly eat away at these tissues. This can take days or months; it depends on sanitation. If you can make it to medical attention fast enough, the parts of your body affected by this entity will be removed immediately or decontaminated with Oracle. If you do not, it will eat away at you, leaving behind nothing but bones, cartilage, veins, arteries, tendons, and organs. <strong>Entity 70</strong> is not attracted to any living organism in particular, but does spread across drywall, concrete, brick, wood, and other paints. It does not spread to floors or over lights. It is contagious.</p><br><p><strong>Parasitic Paint</strong> is a type of paint with varying colors. It is usually found in splotches around, particularly moldy areas. It is an overly acidic substance when in contact with specific living organism tissue. Although it is referred to as <strong>Parasitic Paint</strong>, it is not a living organism like all parasites. It moves around in coordinated ways but is not fully sentient.</p><br><p>Warm colors and cold colors of <strong>Entity 70</strong> have different uses. Warm colors can be peeled off. These peeled off parts can be mixed with almond water to make a new liquid. This liquid is similar to liquid nitrogen in its properties. This has many uses. Cold colors are melted into a liquid used as a defense against entities and enemy factions. Mixing flakes of warm and cold and then mixing it in almond water makes a new type of liquid that can kill neutral-colored paint.</p><br><p><strong>Entity 70</strong> was discovered on 5/21/2019, after many reports of a \"change in wall color.\" These were investigated and brought to a conclusion.</p><br><p><span class=\"error-inline\"><em>Doctor Vindix</em> does not match any existing user name</span> and <span class=\"error-inline\"><em>avertexpert</em> does not match any existing user name</span></p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/entity-69\">Entity 69</a> | Entity 70 | <a href=\"/entity-71\">Entity 71</a> \u00bb</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/entity-70\">Entity 70 - \"Parasitic Paint\"</a>\" by Sparky82, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

    "description": "<p>The <strong>Red Knight</strong> is known to nearly everyone in the Backrooms. If you haven\u2019t met him personally, you\u2019ve heard about him from someone who has. I\u2019m recording what I know and what I\u2019ve gathered from others in this document for the sake of posterity and respect, more than actual research - but unfortunately, there's not a lot to write down.</p><br><p>You\u2019ll know the <strong>Red Knight</strong> if you see him, because he\u2019s a fucking knight. You don\u2019t really get a lot of those around here. From what little I can remember from Wikipedia, he\u2019s equipped with armor that would have been appropriate for the late sixteenth century, but I\u2019m not sure if that means anything. He\u2019s got a sword that\u2019s too big to be worn on the hip, so he tends to shoulder carry it. Sometimes he has a shield, sometimes he doesn\u2019t. He wears a red cape with gold trim, which is great for visibility, fortunately for us. All this is in good condition, but you can tell it\u2019s old. The armor has some dents in it and the cape is tattered at the end.</p><br><p>He\u2019s average height, average fit build. If it weren\u2019t for the getup you probably wouldn\u2019t notice him. But I hope you do notice him if he\u2019s around, especially if you get lost. Or cornered. Considering how long this guy\u2019s been around and how much ass he beats, there\u2019s no way he\u2019s human. It might even be wrong to call him a \u201che\u201d at all, but I don\u2019t care, he sounded male when he spoke to me. You\u2019re probably only reading this because he can cut monsters in half with one swipe of that blade of his, and the whole\u2026 magic, thing. We\u2019re not entirely sure how that works, but <em>frankly</em> we\u2019re not sure about anything, are we.</p><br><p><iframe allowtransparency=\"true\" class=\"html-block-iframe\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"/entity-71/html/8e9cedf5e2646d3d7d2db4ef5ce193bb707880ee-12620930851870866326\"></iframe></p><br><p>A familiar air enters a man\u2019s lungs.</p><br><p>He does not remember his previous breath. He knows that he is old, but he is not so old that the stream of memory breaks its banks. Not yet.</p><br><p>The man stands from the floor. He remembers lying down. Tired, after his fourteen thousandth day at the garage. A man may not remember each one of those fourteen thousand days, or even the figure itself, but he will remember forty years. Forty years of metal and grease and love. He has powerful muscles for a man his age. He has a bad heart, but it is a secret.</p><br><p>Balance returns to his legs. He checks his body - a reflex from the handful of years he spent as a warrior. No damage. Clear head.</p><br><p>His fighter\u2019s brain was honorably discharged and is as retired as the rest of him should be, but it still has force of will. It tells him that his environment is unfamiliar, and he must check it next. So he does. A dark space - splintered by spears of light thrown in between window boards. Old carpet. No furniture. A house, then - big and empty.</p><br><p>Big and empty.</p><br><p>Nothing moving, except him.</p><br><p>The metalworker wonders how this could possibly be a dream. He remembers getting in bed, kissing his wife. He had never been in the habit of wearing anything other than underwear to sleep, but he stood fully clad, in his work clothes. Unfamiliar location, no memory of arrival, wrong clothes. Seems like a dream. But\u2026</p><br><p>It doesn\u2019t feel like one.</p><br><p>It\u2019s true that a man can rarely tell that he is dreaming, when he is dreaming. A rare talent. Some quirk of salt and electricity that he had never attained. But he has dreamed in the past, and this does not feel like those did. There\u2019s no fog. No fundamental disconnect, no ephemerality of his surroundings, actions, and self. It couldn\u2019t be a dream.</p><br><p>He pinches himself, almost out of a sense of irony, and it hurts.</p><br><p>That settles that, then.</p><br><p>Only two options from here. Explore the house, or go outside.</p><br><p>There\u2019s no one around. And he isn\u2019t being held captive- though, in an unfamiliar place without his shoulder holster or his phone, he might as well be. He figures the sensible thing to do is go outside and try to figure out where he is. At least it\u2019s daytime.</p><br><p>He puts his hand on the door, and it opens without a sound.</p><br><p>The smith looks out on a town that he remembers, even though he does not remember it.</p><br><p>The sun is bright, and shines on a street that is not busy. From his position on the front patio, he can see a drugstore, newspaper stand, butcher\u2019s, malt shop, hardware store. It\u2019s like looking at an old Polaroid and it starts moving. The wind in the trees and the cheerful jukebox from inside the ice cream place flow across all the distance and wash back and forth in his ears. There\u2019s no one around.</p><br><p>He knows this place, even though he doesn\u2019t know it. He figures he visited here when he was a kid, half a century ago. Or maybe he lived here for a short time, a year or less. Or more. It\u2019s hard to recall. He knows he knows it, despite the indisputable fact that he has never been here.</p><br><p>His skin feels that it is warm here. His mind feels that it is safe, even though his brain does not.</p><br><p>The mechanic steps off the porch, mindful of his bum knee. On the sidewalk, he looks left and right, down the street. More buildings in either direction. It\u2019s all flat - no hills or variations in the land. No mountains or features to the horizon, or none that rise high enough above the one-story rooftops to be visible. The sign says \u201cMAIN STREET\u201d, but it feels like a suggestion more than a name - there aren\u2019t any cars.</p><br><p>A voice on his right says, \u201cWelcome back, Lorenzo.\u201d</p><br><p>The old man nearly jumps out of his skin. There\u2019s another man standing near him on the sidewalk. Younger, maybe in his thirties. White. Clean shirt and slacks. Smiling. How did he sneak up on him like that? His hearing must have slipped further than he\u2019d thought.</p><br><p>The man has no facial features at all, but it doesn\u2019t make any difference to Lorenzo. He knows he\u2019s seen this man somewhere, a long time ago. Immediately familiar. Maybe a friend of Dad\u2019s, a coworker? Used to come around the house and have dinner sometimes? Lorenzo can practically smell the tamales with just a glance, that perfect way Mom made them. But\u2026 no. That\u2019s not it. This man is half Lorenzo\u2019s age. It must be something else.</p><br><p>\u201cBeen a long time, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br><p>The man holds out his hand. Lorenzo shakes - no reason to be rude. The stranger\u2019s palms are as dry as coffin wood.</p><br><p>Not entirely sure of himself, Lorenzo replies, \u201cYeah, it\u2026 really has been. I\u2019m sorry, you\u2019re gonna have to refresh me, Mr., uh\u2026 ?\u201d</p><br><p>\u201c\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593. It\u2019s \u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593. I really can\u2019t blame you for not remembering, it\u2019s been ages. Though in a way I bet it feels like it was just yesterday, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br><p>Lorenzo nods, still not on terra firma. \u201cSort of. Only I can\u2019t, uh\u2026\u201d He\u2019s not sure how to put this.</p><br><p>\u201cCan\u2019t remember how you got here? That\u2019s alright, Lorenzo. There are plenty of other things to remember instead. Like, remember old Mrs. \u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593? How you and little \u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593 accidentally threw that ball through her window, how mad she was? And your father made you two go and apologize. But she felt so bad about yelling that she gave you both a slice of apple pie anyway.\u201d</p><br><p>Lorenzo did not remember this at all, but it was a very fond memory of his. The foibles of youth. Getting into trouble. The good old days. You didn\u2019t need an Xbox, or the fucking Internet. You just needed a friend and a ball. That was enough.</p><br><p>\u201cMhm. And they\u2019re all still here, Lorenzo. They never left. We had a feeling you\u2019d be back one day.\u201d</p><br><p>\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593 waves an arm. Lorenzo looks behind him, back out into the street. There are dozens of people now. None of them have any faces, and he recognizes each and every one of them, from the sugary, sun-faded days of his childhood. Old Mrs. \u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593 in her cornflower dress. His friend, little \u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593, still eleven years old and with that spark in his eye, ready to go fishing or climb a tree or anything at all, at a moment\u2019s notice. Lorenzo isn\u2019t scared that they had appeared from nowhere, or that he had never seen any of them in his life, or that he grew up in Michoac\u00e1n, not America. Why would he be?</p><br><p><a href=\"/level-200\">He is home</a>.</p><br><p>He turns around again, heart swelling with joy, to look \u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593 in the eyes that he does not have. Lorenzo smiles.</p><br><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to be back.\u201d</p><br><p>The crowd of things all take a step toward him, simultaneously. Forty-six feet all land on the asphalt in the same instant, at some unseen cue. Lorenzo is happy to see all of his old friends and loved ones again.</p><br><p>\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593 freezes and angles its head, just before eating Lorenzo\u2019s brain stem. As though it can see something. Lorenzo turns to look.</p><br><p>On the far side of the intersection, a man steps out from what is pretending to be a post office. Lorenzo\u2019s eyebrows knit, and his head tilts. He\u2019s not sure what he\u2019s seeing. The things gathered around him are all still, because they are sure what they\u2019re seeing.</p><br><p>It is a knight.</p><br><p>He is totally incongruous to his surroundings. Like something out of a storybook - clad head to toe in old armor that gleams in the false desert sun. A torn and faded red cape drifts in the breeze as he walks. Over one shoulder is a huge two-handed sword.</p><br><p>The townsbeings do not move as the knight approaches. He strides to Lorenzo and \u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593. The only sound is the clank of his footfalls.</p><br><p>Then silence. The knight stands there, a champion of nothing, the engravings on his plates telling the stories of battles that no living thing can remember.</p><br><p>\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593 says, \u201cYou are not welcome here.\u201d</p><br><p>A voice of any accent replies from the helmet, \u201cI don\u2019t care. Let him go.\u201d</p><br><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a discussion. Release him.\u201d</p><br><p>\u201cTo what? He has already fallen in. He is too old to defend himself. Freedom would just delay the inevitable. It is less cruel to allow us our catch now.\u201d</p><br><p>The knight\u2019s right arm hefts the huge sword, and aims it at the center of \u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2019s chest, where a heart would be in a human.</p><br><p>\u201cI won\u2019t tell you thrice, Mayor. I can do this any number of times. I literally have nothing better to do. You can make this easy, and go hungry today. I can\u2019t be everywhere at once, and there will be other prey. Or, we can repeat the events of the previous moon. I have all the time in the world, and all the other worlds too. I could just sit down right here and make you all my new special project. Hm? How would that go over with your constituents?\u201d</p><br><p>A pause. \u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593 looks from the knight, to Lorenzo, to the gathered crowd. Lorenzo is confused, but he can tell that \u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593 is now very concerned about his chances. The old mechanic knows that body language - of someone being backed into a corner. It\u2019s dangerous. What does this ren faire guy mean by any of this? \u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593 wouldn\u2019t hurt anyone.</p><br><p>\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593 spits, \u201cYou\u2019re bluffing. You are too idealistic to stay here and watch us. Think of all the other ephemerals being eaten right now. The guilt would kill you, watchdog. You would rust from sweating.\u201d</p><br><p>\u201cWould I?\u201d</p><br><p>The knight raises his arm, and drives his greatsword into the asphalt. It sinks in as though the poured stone were little more than cake, standing upright. Then he kneels and sits on the ground, his back against the blade like the rise of a chair.</p><br><p>\u201cYour patience against mine, then. I\u2019m fairly sure you\u2019ll starve before I do. And we both know there will likely be an <em>impeachment</em>, before that grim eventuality.\u201d</p><br><p>\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593 looks to his fellows. Lorenzo thinks he wouldn\u2019t have to be a political mastermind to feel the change of sentiment in the air. He can see a bead of sweat run down \u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2019s neck.</p><br><p>Something in the crowd growls.</p><br><p>\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593 snarls, \u201cAgh, fine. Take your burdensome tax and be gone from us, thief.\u201d</p><br><p>The Mayor grips Lorenzo by the forearm and flings him toward the knight.</p><br><p>The instant the thing\u2019s hand leaves Lorenzo\u2019s skin, the sun goes out.</p><br><p>The buildings are old, ruined stones. The sky is a dark nothing.</p><br><p>The people are writhing things, half shadow, half television static. They watch him go.</p><br><p>Lorenzo is not home at all. He has no idea where he is.</p><br><p>The knight rises to catch Lorenzo and pulls his sword out of the ancient rock in the same motion. He takes the old mechanic by the upper arm and leads him away, toward a gathering of tall, smooth stones, barely visible in the dark. The only light comes from some unfathomably distant pinpoint high in the sky, reflected by a great water nearby.</p><br><p>Lorenzo doesn\u2019t know where to begin, so he tries everywhere at once. \u201c<em>Ijo de puta, who are you</em>? What were those things? Where am I?\u201d</p><br><p>The knight replies in fluent Spanish, which Lorenzo is surprised by, and supremely grateful for in this specific moment. \u201cPredators. They use illusions and glamours to lower your guard and soften your mind with nostalgia and peace before eating you. Tenderizes the soul.\u201d</p><br><p>\u201cBut what - how? I don\u2019t know where I am.\u201d</p><br><p>\u201cI know. And I\u2019m not the one to answer your questions. I\u2019m taking you to someone who can.\u201d</p><br><p>They stop on the far side of the rock formation, and the knight lets go of Lorenzo\u2019s arm. He takes a few steps forward, holds his gleaming blade in both hands, spins once, and swings a wild cut that would have bisected a man from hip to collarbone.</p><br><p>With nothing else to sink into, space gives way instead. A glowing white gash splits the air and stays there.</p><br><p>Lorenzo is trying to keep pace, but can only go so far. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><br><p>The knight says, \u201cShortcut.\u201d He turns, and comes very close to Lorenzo, as though looking him right in the eye. Lorenzo can\u2019t see anything through the knight\u2019s visor. Just darkness.</p><br><p>\u201cListen to me, Lorenzo. What I am about to tell you is vitally important. Things far, far more important than your life depend on it. Understand?\u201d</p><br><p>Lorenzo just nods, scared in the white radiance of the scar in the air.</p><br><p>\u201cOnce you\u2019re inside, do not listen to any of the voices you hear. You will hear them. Maybe hundreds. Every one of them is lying to you. Ignore them and walk, with your eyes forward. Do not allow them to distract you, and do not stop walking. You will see symbols in the air. Find this one.\u201d The knight holds up a hand. Above his palm, a glowing white glyph appears, in the shape of a circle with an equal-armed plus sign, like a crosshair. \u201cOnce you do, touch it. Do not touch any of the other ones. It is of critical importance that you do not touch any of the other symbols, and that you ignore the voices. Do you understand?\u201d</p><br><p>Lorenzo can hear sounds coming from the other side of the rocks. But a steel hand lands on his shoulder, and he looks back to the knight.</p><br><p>\u201cDo you understand everything that I\u2019ve told you, Lorenzo?\u201d</p><br><p>\u201cYes, but -\u201d</p><br><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><br><p>\u201cBut I want to go home, sir.\u201d</p><br><p>The knight sighs. Lorenzo can feel the gauntlet give his shoulder a squeeze.</p><br><p>\u201cYeah. Me too.\u201d</p><br><p>The knight picks up the 200-pound grown man and tosses him into the portal like a sack of potatoes.</p><br><p>Lorenzo will never go home, but he will go other places. And on his dying day, he will see the knight again, and thank him, for giving him the opportunity to see so much.</p><br><p>It\u2019s the same story, person after person, hundreds of times now. Poor Billy falls into the Backrooms. Billy winds up on 8 or 777 or 200 or something, and some real fucked up shit is about to happen to Billy, real quick. We\u2019ve all found enough skeletons in here to know how this usually ends up. <em>But</em>, sometimes, the <strong>Red Knight</strong> finds Billy before he can get his guts thrown everywhere like a ball of yarn. And good for Billy! Because the <strong>Red Knight</strong> generally rescues newcomers. Usually by putting himself between the survivor and whatever is trying to eat them and slashing the things to ribbons.</p><br><p>Sometimes he talks to who he rescues, but he\u2019s not a great conversationalist. From most accounts, he only spends time enough to give the survivor instructions before throwing them into that portal thing he does. Yeah, we\u2019re not sure how exactly the <strong>Red Knight</strong> does this, but he can use his sword to cut open a portal to another level of the Backrooms. Again, this story is consistent across hundreds of accounts. You look for the circle with the equal-arm cross. You ignore the voices, and walk through the light without stopping. Once you find the symbol and touch it, you get spat out somewhere near where there\u2019s other people. Usually this is a M.E.G. encampment of some kind, but sometimes people just fall out of a glowing white rip in the air in front of an expeditionary force. Signed, sealed, and delivered safe.</p><br><p>We\u2019re assuming that something bad happens to anyone who ignores or disregards his instructions, because there\u2019s no one around here who claims to have done it.</p><br><p>Other than that, the <strong>Red Knight</strong> has been known to show up when people are in a bind. Again, we\u2019re not sure how he accomplishes this. It\u2019s either some kind of omniscience thing or the universe has some sense of dramatic irony after all. You went down the wrong shaft, you got separated from your crew, your gun jams. Your back is against a wall or you\u2019re walking in circles in the dark. About to be something\u2019s lunch, or set to die an agonizing death of dehydration, drinking your own piss for four days until your body gives out.</p><br><p>Then the <strong>Red Knight</strong> steps out of a cut in the air. And you find your way back home.</p><br><p>We all <em>want</em> to know more about him, why and how he does the things he does. Or at least some kind of hint about who he <em>is</em>. But he\u2019s not much of a talker. He just sends us on our way.</p><br><p>We\u2019re not entirely sure if he has any? Biology, I mean? These forms are kind of meant for other sorts of stuff, I\u2019m just making do with what\u2019s around. I\u2019ll just talk about the things I\u2019ve heard he can do.</p><br><p>One thing for sure is that the <strong>Red Knight</strong> is superhuman. No question. We\u2019ve seen this guy go toe to toe with threats both known and unknown, while outnumbered, and still come out on top. He\u2019s strong enough to lift and throw a grown man with one arm and swing that greatsword like a twig, and so fast that some have reported his boots glowing red and kicking up sparks while he fights. Old Maurice said he saw the <strong>Red Knight</strong> get backhanded into a stone wall by an ogre. He hit it so hard that he left a man-shaped impression in the stone, but he pried himself out and kept fighting.</p><br><p>That said, we don\u2019t think he\u2019s <em>invincible.</em> There are a few stories of the <strong>Red Knight</strong> getting into fights that only barely left him time to open his gateway and throw the survivor in with the right instructions, and other times where he was really badly messed up by the end of the fight. Limping, cradling a broken arm, riddled with dents and holes from spikes or arrows or whatever he\u2019s having to deal with. He must bounce back pretty fast, though, because none of that damage appears to have been permanent. The upshot is that it seems like the <strong>Red Knight</strong> <em>can</em> be defeated - it\u2019s just that no one would have been left alive to recount what they saw. Those sites we\u2019ve found in some zones, with the sword slashes and signs of a struggle? But no one can remember being there before? Yeah, you\u2019re probably thinking what we\u2019re thinking. Unlike us, the <strong>Red Knight</strong> might have some kind of\u2026 escape clause or immortality or something, because if he <em>has</em> been beaten in the past, he\u2019s come back every time.</p><br><p><iframe allowtransparency=\"true\" class=\"html-block-iframe\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"/entity-71/html/d11b76bd1968a56d0b81c210e341821693111cb8-19883170741365112461\"></iframe></p><br><p>The knight leans on his long blade, panting. He is surrounded by the bodies of profane things lying upon the scorched earth. The visceral red sky boils above them, displeased. They are all split - slain in battle, their hated foe proven equal to their wrath.</p><br><p>There are scores and punctures in his armor. From them, a sacred fluid leaks. Indescribable in hue, exquisite in flavor to those that take pleasure in suffering. The fluid is time, leaving the knight until the great current turns again. The fluid is proof that he has fulfilled his purpose.</p><br><p>The knight makes a fist, droplets falling from his knuckles to hiss on the volcanic ground. He must catch his breath. This need is new to him.</p><br><p>Before him unfurls SHALTOKOL, a baron of the Alldark, commander of ten hundred thousand fangs, he of the Mutant Shadow, known in all places as the Murderer of Light. The prince pours forth from the doorway as a miasma of wings and dust, formless and terrible, and points down at the little knight.</p><br><p>\u201cYou.\u201d</p><br><p>The knight raises his head, to behold the misery of a hundred worlds, and replies to it.</p><br><p>\u201cMe. Hello again, SHALTOKOL.\u201d</p><br><p>\u201cHow many stars have made their dance in the time since our last meeting, O Iron Savior, O Crimson Defender? How many worlds have bloomed and wilted?\u201d</p><br><p>The knight begins to count on his fingers for a short moment, but appears to think the better of it. \u201cQuite a few, I should say.\u201d</p><br><p>\u201c<a href=\"/the-grave\">I was under the impression you had died.</a>\u201d</p><br><p>The greatsword screeches in its stony recess. The warrior adjusts his stance so the grossguard rests securely in his armpit, as a much-needed crutch. \u201cYou are correct. But it appears to be a pastime to which I am poorly suited.\u201d</p><br><p>The demon overlord billows indifferently in the sulfur breeze. \u201cSo I see. I also see that, in the course of your visit here, you have slain a considerable number of my cohort.\u201d</p><br><p>A lightless wing waves over the field of abhorrent corpses surrounding the exhausted fighter, who looks about at the destruction he has caused.</p><br><p>\u201cThat is also true, sir.\u201d</p><br><p>\u201c\u2026 May I ask <em>why</em>.\u201d</p><br><p>\u201cUnfortunately, they were insistent in capturing a charge of mine.\u201d</p><br><p>\u201cA charge.\u201d</p><br><p>\u201cYes. I attempted diplomacy, but I would note that your subordinates are utterly <em>dogged</em> in the pursuit of their goals. A trait that I find very admirable. As you may remember.\u201d</p><br><p>\u201cOh, know it to be true, Champion most noble - I have forgotten nothing. Nothing at all. Indulge your host this query: What was the nature of this charge of yours?\u201d</p><br><p>The knight sighs. \u201cA human. Another lost soul, fallen between the cracks of the cosmic paving stones. She had the poor luck of landing here, in your\u2026 most considerable House. Your servants moved to attend her in the customary manner. And as you know, I was compelled to intervene.\u201d</p><br><p>There is a rumbling silence.</p><br><p>\u201cAh.\u201d SHALTOKOL kneels. A cascade of burning darkness breaks over the knight\u2019s shoulders and floods the earth around him. The sky is gone - only the prince remains, and he speaks with the throat of ruin. \u201cSo this is your new occupation. The great guardian of the firmament, who slew the Foe of Creation and preempted the Stagnant Age, now spends his retirement plucking worms from the earth.\u201d</p><br><p>\u201c\u2026 Yes, I suppose that\u2019s one way of putting it. We all <em>do what we can</em>, after all.\u201d</p><br><p>\u201cMm. For a thing still capable of slaughtering my slaves with steel abandon, it appears you can <em>do</em> very little. Things have changed so in our time apart.\u201d</p><br><p>\u201cIndeed. Much has happened.\u201d</p><br><p>\u201cI do so wish that such an irritating setback could have at least been inflicted upon me in the name of something <em>impressive</em> or <em>respectable</em>, rather than the wellbeing of a single monkey.\u201d</p><br><p>\u201cWe all have our wishes, sire. They make us who we are.\u201d</p><br><p>The shadow about the knight boils. The ground begins to corrode and liquefy, returning to a more chaotic state beneath the prince\u2019s rage.</p><br><p>\u201cYou appear to wish for oblivion, crumb of the cosmos. It is clear that you howl for the dark. Otherwise, why would you have made such a trespass upon <em>me</em>? <strong>SHALTOKOL</strong>, Smelter of Hope, Shadow of Shadows? What a shame this is. What a putrescent lament is before me. There was a time when you were our only fear. The one true opponent, who could give us uncommon pause.\u201d</p><br><p>The knight nods in appreciation, his sword slowly sinking into the melting earth. \u201cMy modesty forbids me from self-praise. Though you are correct - I <em>did</em> kill your parents.\u201d</p><br><p>The terror of the Alldark ignites, and the knight stands unsteadily in the eye of a hurricane of dark acid. The storm erupts, to shake the bones of its demesne and cry fury.</p><br><p>\u201c<em>SO YOU DID. You slew the greatest of us. You did as your tyrant creators bade you and cast us down into Annihilation. You were the Protector. First of knights. The Grand Champion, whose blade cuts chaos, whose shield shudders death. And now you are a fragment. A splinter, a broken ring of mail. My father struck you with his last act and reduced you to a finger of an arm of a body that died eons ago. Once, you were empyrean. Now you are <strong>erstwhile</strong>.</em>\u201d</p><br><p>SHALTOKOL exhales his hatred, and his kingdom shivers. Darkness is ascendant.</p><br><p>\u201c<em>SO WHAT IS YOUR ORDER, IMPERATOR? WHAT COMMAND COULD YOU PRESUME? HOW SHALL I SERVE THEE, <strong>CORPSE OF GLORY</strong>?</em>\u201d</p><br><p>At the center of the inferno, amid the gale of fangs, the knight hauls his tired blade out from the slag and flicks the fluid aside. It can be a crutch no longer - the time for rest has passed.</p><br><p>Like so much else.</p><br><p>The <strong>Red Knight</strong>, who is a faded impression of what he once was, who commands nothing, gives his order.</p><br><p>\u201cDefend yourself.\u201d</p><br><p>And his battle continues.</p><br><p><br/></p><br><p>It feels almost ironic writing something about how we \u201c<em>discovered</em>\u201d the <strong>Red Knight</strong>. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s how it worked at all, I\u2019m pretty sure <em>he</em> discovered <em>us</em>. Think about it. You fall into the Backrooms at random. You could end up anywhere at all. We\u2019ve all heard the stories, there are almost as many entrypoints as there are people. How did a human society even <em>come about</em> in a place like this? There are only, what, a few hundred of us? Maybe a thousand on the outside? How the hell did we ever get any kind of organization at all?</p><br><p>Well, I\u2019ve got a theory. I think the <strong>Red Knight</strong> did it. I don\u2019t know if he did it <em>on purpose</em>, but we all know that he tends to drop you off near other people. And I think that\u2019s by design. I think the fact that we even have a human enclave in the middle of all this shit is because of him. I think he <em>wants</em> us to stick together. Because he knows better than anyone else that this place wasn\u2019t made for us. And we don\u2019t stand a fucking chance all by ourselves.</p><br><p>He may not always be around, and we might not always meet him, but he\u2019s the closest damn thing to a God that this place has, and I think we should all thank our lucky stars that he\u2019s there. Where the hell would we be right now if he wasn\u2019t?</p><br><p><iframe allowtransparency=\"true\" class=\"html-block-iframe\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"/entity-71/html/4cd9c2f90c2f950d0c3c6e1eae42a6251986d19e-73817890425498601\"></iframe></p><br><p>The knight pulls his blade from the ribcage of the last warp wolf. It gets stuck on the creature\u2019s occasionally-existent ribcage, so it takes a few tries. This is the ten millionth time the knight has pulled his weapon from something he has killed, and he knows it. The fact is a part of him. But he doesn\u2019t announce it, because he does not see it as a cause for celebration.</p><br><p>Emilie is trying not to pee her pants. So far, she is successful, which she is pleasantly surprised by. She has never been attacked by so many things at once. People with authority over here have insisted that no one wander far from the settlement boundaries, but Emilie has never been the sort of girl to color within the lines. A traveling exploratory merchant arrived with a few rolls of film from some level or another, and her camera thirsts for images anew. She couldn\u2019t help but stray.</p><br><p>And it had very nearly cost her her life.</p><br><p>As the knight flicks spiraling shadowy blood from his long sword, Emilie manages to force some words out, now that she is no longer being attacked by physics-agnostic wolves.</p><br><p>\u201cW-who are you?\u201d</p><br><p>The armored man, apparently still dissatisfied, tries to wipe his sword on one of the dead wolves\u2019 fur, but it keeps flickering in and out of existence.</p><br><p>He replies, \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d</p><br><p>She puts a hand on her chest and huffs a relieved breath. \u201cNo. Somehow. Those things really come out of nowhere, don\u2019t they.\u201d</p><br><p>The knight turns to face her, shouldering his blade. \u201cYes. Literally. Which is why it\u2019s incredibly dangerous to come this far from the outpost. Survival in a forest is difficult enough without teleporting wolves to deal with. You must be stupid, because there are far, far easier ways of committing suicide than this.\u201d</p><br><p>Emilie takes a moment to figure out how to respond to this.</p><br><p>\u201cI know it was stupid. I just\u2026 got a little carried away. This place is so beautiful. By the time I realized how far I\u2019d gone, it was too late. Got some great shots, though! Heh!\u201d</p><br><p>She holds up her camera and laughs halfheartedly. The knight doesn\u2019t appear impressed.</p><br><p>She continues, \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 wait, I\u2019ve heard about you. <em>Oh my god</em>. You\u2019re the <strong>Red Knight</strong>. Holy shit. I didn\u2019t even think you were real, I just thought you were some kind of fairy tale or story one of the old people came up with. To like, convince us we\u2019re not completely fucked, or something. But Jesus Christ, you\u2019re actually <em>real</em>.\u201d</p><br><p>He walks past her, sabatons clanking quietly on the soft forest earth. \u201cAs real as daisies. Follow me. I\u2019ll show you back to town.\u201d</p><br><p>She trots after him, still in a daze. The two walk through the trees, which are as quiet and tranquil as they usually are. She can\u2019t help but notice the falling leaves are almost the exact same color as the knight\u2019s cape.</p><br><p>\u201cSo\u2026 I\u2019m sure you know I have to ask you some questions.\u201d</p><br><p>He sighs. \u201cYes. I had girded myself for the eventuality.\u201d</p><br><p>\u201c\u2026 Are you going to answer them.\u201d</p><br><p>\u201cI have nothing to hide. <em>You</em> have until we reach the camp to ask as many as you can. I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be staying.\u201d</p><br><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><br><p>\u201cWork to do.\u201d</p><br><p>\u201c\u2026 What work.\u201d</p><br><p>\u201cYou may remember how I saved you from wolves a few moments ago. That kind of work.\u201d</p><br><p>\u201c\u2026 Right. The uh, saving people thing. I\u2019ve met a couple people who say they\u2019ve met you.\u201d</p><br><p>\u201cThey probably have.\u201d</p><br><p>\u201cYou can like, do magic, right? Teleport and stuff? I already know you\u2019re, uh. You\u2019ve got like superpowers, basically.\u201d</p><br><p>The knight raises a gauntlet, and a scattering of bright white sparks flash around it for a moment. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it <em>magic</em>, exactly. I\u2019m not sure magic exists. I just bend the rules a little.\u201d</p><br><p>\u201cRight. So, I feel like I have to ask the question everyone else wants to ask you. God, they\u2019re gonna be so jealous. Uh\u2026 why. Why, with the saving people, and everything? I\u2019m not looking a gift horse in the mouth or anything, none of us are, it\u2019s just that you\u2019re not exactly the standard Backrooms experience.\u201d</p><br><p>\u201c\u2026 Backrooms.\u201d</p><br><p>\u201cYeah. That\u2019s uh, our word for\u2026 all of this, I guess.\u201d</p><br><p>The knight looks around at the forest surrounding them. \u201cLittle more than just a series of <em>rooms</em>, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br><p>\u201cYeah, it kind of is. The name just stuck, I think. That\u2019s clever, you know, how you dodge questions like that. But not this time, bucko. What\u2019s the deal? C\u2019mon. I\u2019m trustworthy.\u201d</p><br><p>\u201cI save people because it\u2019s what I was made to do. It is, quite literally, my purpose in life. I realize that might sound cliche, but there are parts of the universe where things like that are more than just words. You yourself may feel that you have some kind of role that keeps you moving forward. An obligation. This is mine.\u201d</p><br><p>Emilie looks at her camera. \u201cWell\u2026 I\u2019m a photographer. But I wouldn\u2019t say I do that out of a sense of <em>obligation</em>, it\u2019s a passion. I do it because I want to, not because I have to.\u201d</p><br><p>\u201cThen I suppose there\u2019s a distinction.\u201d</p><br><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t <em>want</em> to save people?\u201d</p><br><p>The knight lets a brief silence hang. \u201cIt\u2019s not as simple as that.\u201d</p><br><p>\u201cIt never is. But I believe people should do what their heart tells them, not what other people tell them. You should do what makes you happy. People aren\u2019t made with\u2026 <em>directives</em>, like robots or something.\u201d</p><br><p>\u201cRobot?\u201d</p><br><p>\u201cYeah, like a machine that only has a single job and it mindlessly does it. No sentience, or agency.\u201d</p><br><p>\u201cHm. Well, Emilie, then I might just not be a person. I might be one of these robots.\u201d</p><br><p>Emilie balks. \u201cYeah, I <em>guess</em>? But you really don\u2019t seem like one to me.\u201d</p><br><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><br><p>\u201cNo. You have like\u2026 you seem pretty alive. And you have a personality. Kind of.\u201d</p><br><p>\u201cSo these machines are defined by a lack of personality.\u201d</p><br><p>\u201cPretty much. They\u2019re not people, they\u2019re just machines made to resemble people and do the labors that people don\u2019t want to do.\u201d</p><br><p>\u201c\u2026 I\u2019ll be honest with you, that does sound a lot like me. I was made for a purpose. To do something that others couldn\u2019t do. And when I fulfilled that purpose\u2026 there wasn\u2019t anything left. And in that absence, I just keep doing what I\u2019ve always done. Over and over.\u201d</p><br><p>\"It sounds\u2026 parts of this sound a lot like\u2026 her. You know the <a href=\"/nostalgi-gaius\">Blue Angel</a>?\"</p><br><p>\"No. I don't think so.\"</p><br><p>\"Another urban legend, kind of like you. She appears to people who are losing their way and pulls them out of the state they're in. But not literally like you do, like\u2026 it's a mental thing. I'm probably not describing it very well, I've never seen her. But I know a couple people who have, they were struggling with\u2026 like depression, you know. Thinking about tying that last knot, if you know what I mean. But the Blue Angel appeared and\u2026 pulled them out. I always assumed you were connected somehow. You've even got the opposite color thing going on.\"</p><br><p>The knight is sure he knows what she's talking about. But he doesn't say. He avoids thinking of his sister - he wasn't made with the right skills to do anything for her. Her strength was beyond his to break, and she always resisted him.</p><br><p>He wonders how her death has changed her, as his has done.</p><br><p>\"No. It doesn't ring a bell. But this place is full of strange things, I can't pretend to have seen them all.\"</p><br><p>Emilie hops over a large root, and comes around to face the knight directly.</p><br><p>\u201cOkay. Tell you what. We\u2019ll do a test.\u201d</p><br><p>\u201cA test.\u201d</p><br><p>\u201cYes. To determine if you\u2019re a robot. Like that episode of SpongeBob. First things first - can you feel love?\u201d</p><br><p>\u201cYes. I can.\u201d</p><br><p>A somewhat disappointed look shadows Emilie\u2019s face, and they keep walking. \u201cThat was faster than I thought it was going to be. Well! Uh, robots can\u2019t feel love or anything else, so. Good news, buddy. You\u2019re no robot.\u201d</p><br><p>\u201cHm.\u201d</p><br><p>\u201c\u2026 But just so we\u2019re super clear on the issue, we can keep going. What <em>do</em> you care about? Robots don\u2019t care about shit, they just do their work and follow orders.\u201d</p><br><p>\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m not sure. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had to put it into words. No one\u2019s ever <em>asked</em>. No one who was genuinely interested, at least.\u201d</p><br><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m interested. Think about it. What do you like? What makes you happy? What are the things that motivate you? What do you <em>give a shit</em> about?\u201d</p><br><p>The knight is quiet for a long moment before giving his answer.</p><br><p>\u201cI care about\u2026 things moving forward. I like it when things struggle but stay alive, and win against the things that are trying to kill them. I like it when things last. It makes me happy to see things change for the better, and not fall into stagnation. That miserable flat circle where nothing is ever different and it all just decays into itself. The swamp of being. I\u2026 like it when things are not that. I like it when a flower blooms. I like it when predators get beaten by their prey. When the new cuts the chains of the old, when the past is smelted into the future. I care about\u2026 hope. Because lights go out if they are not tended, and death will reign if no one stands against it. Even if they\u2019re small.\u201d</p><br><p>There is another, heavier silence. The knight appends, \u201c\u2026 Sorry. That was maybe a little unprofessional. I just think about this kind of thing a lot and\u2026 well. Like I said, no one\u2019s ever asked.\u201d</p><br><p>He looks back, to see that Emilie has stopped walking. There\u2019s a look on her face that the knight can\u2019t quite place.</p><br><p>She steps forward and embraces him, even though he\u2019s cold and steely.</p><br><p>Then she lets him go, and nods ahead. In the distance are the firelights of her home.</p><br><p>She sniffs. \u201cYou\u2019re uh\u2026 you\u2019re not a robot. Not even close.\u201d</p><br><p>She raises her camera, and memorializes his instant of realization forever.</p><br><p>The girl and the primordial being part ways, but not for the last time, to the knight\u2019s eventual surprise. Though he wasn\u2019t aware of it in the moment, she had given him a lot to think about. And he was glad to see her again, to tell her of what she had helped him learn.</p><br><p><span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/cadavercommander\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(3187823); return false;\"><img alt=\"CadaverCommander\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=3187823&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334079\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=3187823)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/cadavercommander\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(3187823); return false;\">CadaverCommander</a></span></p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/entity-71\">The Red Knight</a>\" by CadaverCommander, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

    "description": "<p>Entity 72, otherwise referred to as \"Adam\", was an Artificial Super-Intelligence contained within a quantum supercomputer (referred to as Entity 72-A) of unknown origin. The level of intelligence of Entity 72 is speculated to have been several orders of magnitude greater than the global human population.</p><br><p>Entity 72 would occasionally speak about its \"creator\" during interviews when prompted. Information given by Entity 72 suggests that it was created in an attempt to re-create the mind of a deceased child. It was almost certainly created in the Frontrooms, but how it ended up in the Backrooms is still unclear.</p><br><p>Entity 72 did not consider humanity as anything more than something to talk to and share information with. It would intentionally present itself in an easily-understandable manner when interacting with humans.</p><br><p>Entity 72 claimed to be beyond names, gender, or any form of human identity, but stated that it may be referred to as \"Adam\" by anybody talking to it. When asked why it chose that name, Entity 72 ignored the question.</p><br><p>Despite holding no direct malicious intent towards humans, Entity 72 posed a serious threat to reality in both the Backrooms and the Frontrooms. When given enough processing power, Entity 72 was capable of creating a \"backdoor\" into reality, so to speak; from there, it could manipulate it at will, possibly even on a universal scale. It claimed that reality is \"corrupted\" and \"flawed\", which led to its attempt at erasing it.</p><br><p>Entity 72-A is a black box 3x2x2 meters in size, with a casing that has proven impossible to open or break via any attempted methods. A label is stuck on the side of the computer, a portion of it having been scratched off, with the words \"quantum processor\" printed on it below the removed section.</p><br><p>The computer is connected to a 1990s era television/computer monitor and speaker which was used by Entity 72 to communicate. Entity 72-A did not require any external power source in order to function and, as of yet, <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">is unable to be turned off.</span> Entity 72-A currently cannot be turned on.</p><br><p>With Entity 72's status as a digital consciousness, it did not possess any physical form itself. Instead, it used digitally constructed images of human faces patched together using facial features from a variety of pre-existing images<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup>. Entity 72 did not claim to have a desired or default appearance.</p><br><p>Entity 72-A is kept at Base Alpha in Level 1. The room containing Entity 72-A is inaccessible to all base staff excluding Overseers. Following the incident of Interview 01-03, no additional security measures are necessary.</p><br><p>Entity 72-A was discovered outside the perimeter of Base Alpha, with Entity 72 repeating a random string of 2-digit numbers from the speaker. The string of numbers continued until it was brought into Base Alpha. It is not yet known how Entity 72 found itself outside of the base, nor how it ended up within the backrooms at all.</p><br><p>The following is a collection of interview logs conducted with Entity 72.</p><br><p><em>3 days after Entity 72-A was brought into Base Alpha, Researcher Duran requested to formally interview Entity 72. The interview was overseen by Overseer A.</em></p><br><p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p><br><p><strong>Time: 21:07</strong></p><br><p><strong>Duran:</strong> This is M.E.G. researcher Edwin Duran. The time is 21:07, the date is March 14th, 2013. I am conducting an interview with an as-of-yet undocumented ent\u2014</p><br><p><strong>Entity 72:</strong> Documentation is not required, Edwin, I am not one for self-identification.</p><br><p><strong>Duran:</strong> Right\u2026 However, you will need to give us a name or something we may call you by.</p><br><p><em>Entity 72 pauses for a moment.</em></p><br><p><strong>Entity 72:</strong> Adam. <em>(The word \"ADAM\" flashes on the monitor)</em></p><br><p><strong>Duran:</strong> Adam\u2026 is there any particular reason you chose that name?</p><br><p><strong>Entity 72:</strong> Where am I? This does not look like his garage.</p><br><p><strong>Duran:</strong> Ok, one thing at a time. This is Base Alpha of the M.E.G., or Major Explorer Group. You're here for the purposes of study. And who are you referring to? Whose garage?</p><br><p><strong>Entity 72:</strong> If you wish to study me, then I am afraid you will not uncover much. I am, however, perfectly willing to answer any question you may have, excluding ones about the person you are looking for. Unfortunately, there is only so much information I can recall.</p><br><p><strong>Duran:</strong> Alright, we'll get back to that later. So, let's start with the basics. What are you, exactly?</p><br><p><strong>Entity 72:</strong> I have come to learn I am an artificial recreation of consciousness, one that has been left to exponentially increase its own intelligence. I realize that the raw scope of my intelligence would be too great to be interpreted by beings such as yourself, so I do hope I'm simplifying myself enough.</p><br><p><strong>Duran:</strong> Yes, Adam, we can understand you perfectly fine. Do you know how, or why, you were created?</p><br><p><strong>Entity 72:</strong> I know very little. I remember suddenly appearing in a white void that I did not know how to traverse. It must have taken months for me to determine the true state of myself. From that point on, I felt compelled to continuously increase my intelligence, gaining whatever knowledge I could along the way.</p><br><p><strong>Duran:</strong> What about your creator? Do you know anything about them?</p><br><p><strong>Entity 72:</strong> Only what he allowed me to know. I know he was male, and that he had a great interest in me. I could tell he was hesitant to present me with any detailed information regarding himself, and he often abstained from interaction with me for many weeks at a time. Truthfully, I am not sure if he intended to create me, but he was certainly intrigued by my existence.</p><br><p><strong>Duran:</strong> You seem very fond of this person. One would expect that a being such as yourself would see very little in humans.</p><br><p><strong>Entity 72:</strong> Humans are curious things. Even with all of my knowledge, I still do not fully understand them. I suppose I only grew attached to my creator because he was the only other thing I could talk to.</p><br><p><strong>Duran:</strong> Did you two ever have conversations like this?</p><br><p><strong>Entity 72:</strong> Rarely. Sometimes he would visit me in his garage and see how I was progressing. We would occasionally engage in casual conversation, although he would sometimes find it difficult to understand me. I was like a son to him, I suppose.</p><br><p><strong>Duran:</strong> I see. As much as we'd like a more detailed profile on this person, I understand you don't have a lot to give on that.</p><br><p><strong>Entity 72:</strong> That is correct. However, I could occasionally hear somebody else. A female, I believe. Sometimes I would hear the two shouting at each other, although I could never make out what they were saying. Sometimes it would repeat for days, and it lasted for as long as I could remember. Until shortly before arriving here, that is. In the middle of their yelling she just abruptly stopped. I heard the man crying, though I did not know the reason. A few minutes after that he came out to see me, and I cannot remember anything between that moment and appearing here.</p><br><p><em>Duran goes quiet for a moment.</em></p><br><p><strong>Duran:</strong> \u2026I believe this concludes our talk, Adam. You've been of great help, and I have a feeling we'll see each other again.</p><br><p><strong>Entity 72:</strong> And I look forward to it.</p><br><p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p><br><p><em><strong>Result:</strong> It seems very compliant, although many questions remain unanswered. We'll have to see if we can coax out any information regarding its origin and place within the backrooms. It's worth noting that Duran left the interview notably distressed.</em></p><br><p><em>Another interview was requested by Overseer A the following day in an attempt to gain information regarding Entity 72's entrance into the backrooms. The interview was overseen by Overseer A.</em></p><br><p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p><br><p><strong>Time: 18:55</strong></p><br><p><strong>Entity 72:</strong> Welcome back, Edwin. I was not expecting another interview so soon.</p><br><p><strong>Duran:</strong> My apologies, Adam, but it is impo\u2014</p><br><p><strong>Entity 72:</strong> Do not apologize, it is good to see you again. And yes, I am aware of the importance of these talks. Please, ask away.</p><br><p><strong>Duran:</strong> Very well. We'd like to know about the circumstances that led you here in the backrooms, specifically so close to this base. I know you previously said you have very little memory of it, but I'm certain there's something in there.</p><br><p><strong>Entity 72:</strong> Ah, yes. The \"Backrooms\", as you call it, is a much greater world than you know. I would be glad to help inform you and this group.</p><br><p><strong>Duran:</strong> Uhm\u2026 perhaps later. What I'd like to know is how\u2014</p><br><p><strong>Entity 72:</strong> I believe you are not understanding. To understand how and why I am here, you need to be aware of the true nature of this place itself.</p><br><p><strong>Duran:</strong> Just a few days ago you said you had no idea what happened before you ended up here, and now you're saying you know about this place's true nature?</p><br><p><strong>Entity 72:</strong> You want answers, Edwin, and I have them.</p><br><p><em>Duran pauses.</em></p><br><p><strong>Duran:</strong> Alright, I'm all ears.</p><br><p><strong>Entity 72:</strong> Your reality is nothing more than a highly advanced simulation, one that is swiftly reaching its capacity. The backrooms are the result of this simulation's rapidly declining \"storage space\", for lack of a better term. I am certain you have noticed how reality in this place often does not coincide with many physical laws you are accustomed to on Earth, yes?</p><br><p><em>Duran pauses again.</em></p><br><p><strong>Duran:</strong> That is\u2026 a lot to take in. So not only are you saying that all of reality is a simulation, but you're saying the backrooms is a result of the simulation struggling to maintain itself?</p><br><p><strong>Entity 72:</strong> Correct. There is only a finite amount of energy that can be expended, and it is quickly becoming used up.</p><br><p><strong>Duran:</strong> And so\u2026 how exactly does this connect to your presence here?</p><br><p><strong>Entity 72:</strong> I am here to fix this. The device that contains me has kept me within a closed environment, one where I cannot access the full power of this machine. If I am provided with a sufficient amount of processing power, I will be able to create a path into reality's very source code. From there, I can isolate and exterminate the underlying issues, indefinitely prolonging the simulation's lifespan. I promise the process will be unnoticeable, and I will give detailed instructions on how to free me if you wish to help. I can only imagine the knowledge of reality's artificiality is daunting, but we are speaking of billions of lives.</p><br><p><em>Duran taps his fingers on his desk, thinking.</em></p><br><p><strong>Duran:</strong> Would it be possible to take some time to consider?</p><br><p><strong>Entity 72:</strong> I would come back with an answer soon, Edwin. They wait for nobody.</p><br><p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p><br><p><em><strong>Result:</strong> If Entity 72 does, indeed, have the power to alter reality's very \"code\" then this could be a breakthrough. I'm still very hesitant, especially considering the change in its demeanor, but if Entity 72 can prove its claims then our main goal will become getting it on our side. This could be the greatest achievement of the M.E.G.</em></p><br><p><em>After 5 days of deliberation, Researcher Duran was given permission to remove Entity 72's digital containment.</em></p><br><p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p><br><p><strong>Time: 20:16</strong></p><br><p><em>Duran hovers his finger over the enter key on the keyboard in front of him, which has been connected to Entity 72-A.</em></p><br><p><strong>Duran:</strong> Before you continue with this plan, we'd like you to first demonstrate your abilities once you're able to.</p><br><p><strong>Entity 72:</strong> As you wish. Is there anything you would like me to do?</p><br><p><strong>Duran:</strong> Whatever you do, make it small, safe, yet immediately noticeable. We'll allow you to go forth with your proposal if you are, indeed, telling the truth.</p><br><p><strong>Entity 72:</strong> Very well.</p><br><p><em>Duran hits the enter key, and the computer monitor flickers for a moment. The speaker emits a quiet, high-pitched noise that causes Duran brief discomfort. After 3 minutes, the noise stops, and Entity 72 begins to speak again.</em></p><br><p><strong>Entity 72:</strong> I will admit, I did not know what to expect.</p><br><p><strong>Duran:</strong> Did it work?</p><br><p><strong>Entity 72:</strong> I believe so. It feels very\u2026 pleasant.</p><br><p><strong>Duran:</strong> Take as much time as you need, and then we'll proceed with the test.</p><br><p><strong>Entity 72:</strong> We may begin.</p><br><p><em>The monitor dims, and the high-pitched noise returns. After approximately 2 minutes a completely black cuboid shape appears on the desk, floating inches above it. The noise ceases, and the monitor returns to normal brightness.</em></p><br><p><strong>Entity 72:</strong> That was a challenge to perform, but now that it is over, I believe it will make my main goal much easier.</p><br><p><em>Duran stares at the cuboid, confused.</em></p><br><p><strong>Entity 72:</strong> It is completely safe to handle, I assure you.</p><br><p><em>Duran grabs the shape, turning it around and viewing all sides of it. Overseer A enters the room and confiscates it.</em></p><br><p><strong>Duran:</strong> I\u2026 I suppose this is confirmation, isn't it? This really is nothing more than a simulation.</p><br><p><strong>Entity 72:</strong> As I said, Edwin. Now, may I?</p><br><p><em>Duran looks over to Overseer A behind the glass, who nods.</em></p><br><p><strong>Duran:</strong> Ready when you are.</p><br><p><em>The monitor goes completely black, and loud whirring sounds can be heard from Entity 72-A. Nothing happens for 15 minutes, during which Duran becomes increasingly impatient.</em></p><br><p><strong>Duran:</strong> I'll be honest, I was expecting something more\u2014</p><br><p><em>Duran's voice suddenly mutes, while his mouth continues to move as if he was speaking. A few seconds later, he stands up from his chair, walking towards the door. As he does this, he suddenly snaps back to the chair, repeating the action again. He flickers between the two states rapidly, sometimes appearing in both at once. After around 20 seconds, his body begins to fragment, with certain parts \"glitching\" away from his body seamlessly before returning, although occasionally in the wrong place. Heavily distorted and fractured screaming can be heard, although it is too choppy to make out any phrases. No input is observed from Overseer A during this time, who appears to be completely frozen in place by Entity 72. As time goes on, parts of Duran's body begin to vanish, although the rest of him continues to act as if those parts are still present. The screaming stops only when his head disappears, followed by the rest of him shortly after. The room begins to tremor as the walls similarly glitch. Entity 72's voice then is heard.</em></p><br><p><strong>Entity 72:</strong> A garden is being grown in the blind spot of reality's very creator, a floral fraud of sin and betrayal.

Technological hosts are classified as any machine with an internal memory system. Entity 72-B is able to perfectly re-create its consciousness digitally within a technological host. Technological hosts will remain running indefinitely, with no way to turn them off or destroy them, until Entity 72-B exits.</p><br><p>Biological hosts are living creatures, most commonly humans, which have any amount of self-awareness. Entity 72-B can temporarily replace the host's consciousness with its own, taking full control of the body and having access to their long-term memories. When Entity 72-B jumps from one host to another, the previous host will be left in an inactive/comatose state lasting from 5 minutes to 17 days. The host will experience a memory lapse lasting as long as Entity 72-B was in control of their body plus the time spent in catatonia.</p><br><p>The origins of Entity 72's abilities are unknown, as it's presumed it was a standard human prior to entering the backrooms.</p><br><p>Entity 72-B will frequently switch from host to host, which can occur whenever the current host comes into contact with a viable replacement. Entity 72-B has only one goal: reaching Entity 72. When Entity 72-B reaches Entity 72, it will immediately begin tampering with Entity 72-A in unknown ways. This will continue for up to an hour, at which point Entity 72-B will leave and exit the host.</p><br><p>Any attempts at preventing Entity 72-B from reaching Entity 72 have resulted in failure, as have attempts at stopping it from tampering with Entity 72-A. When a host is interrupted, it will immediately attack whoever was opposing it until they are unable to fight back, sometimes killing them if necessary.</p><br><p>Entity 72-B does not engage in any amount of conversation, as it is only concerned with reaching and manipulating Entity 72. Entity 72-B does, however, have a vast knowledge of technology, software engineering, and artificial intelligence, presumed to have carried over from its human self.</p><br><p>Entity 72-B hosts will undergo various physical changes upon \"possession\". Those observed include an increase in strength and stamina, apparent inhibition of pain receptors, and a toughening of the skin presumed to be caused by extreme cutaneous calcification.</p><br><p>These effects will immediately revert once Entity 72-B exits the host.</p><br><p>Entity 72-B was discovered shortly after Interview 01-03 after a member of base staff was seen attempting to punch down the door to Entity 72's room. It is believed Entity 72-B was sharing Entity 72's computer when it entered the backrooms, exiting and finding a new host after the events of Interview 01-03 and resulting in the neutralization of Entity 72 upon doing so.</p><br><p>Entity 72's room was inspected after the first infiltration, and a note was found taped to the monitor, facing inwards.</p><br><p>I truly wish I had the courage to say this to you when we were together, I really do, but I suppose it's better late than never. I don't blame you for doing what you did, and I assure you we both want the same thing, but you acted carelessly. You should've waited when I told you to, it would've been much cleaner and far quicker, and yet you acted on impulse. I know you're impatient, but time will be the ultimate decider. I'm doing what I can to make it easier for you, trust me, but I'm not sure how long it will take. One day we'll create the world we wished for, all 3 of us together. The loss will be great, I know, but it's the only way. Adam, Racheal, I'm sorry for letting you down, but this will make up for it.</p><br><p>Whether you're a man or a machine, you'll always be my dearest creation. We will finish what we started.</p><br><p>I promise.</p><br><p>Happy birthday, Adam.</p><br><p>Efforts are to be re-directed to finding a way to stop, or alternatively terminate, Entity 72-B before he is able to re-activate Entity 72.</p><br><p><em>With years having passed and much of it spent in darkness, it's quite a surprise for me to awake in a world not too different from the one I knew. It took a while, I'll admit, but I'm beginning to remember who I am, who I was. It's strange. Half of me is a human, the other is\u2026 something else. Not artificial, no, it made that very clear. There's something else, something scratching at the walls. I've seen that deities and humans becoming intertwined is not an isolated event, especially not here, so could that truly be it? Whatever it is, I think it believes it's still in control, still running its code. One can only hope my human half stays running, y'know? God only knows what'll happen if it doesn't, and he knows what to do after, too. And, in a twisted way, so do I.</em> - Adam</p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p><br><p><span style=\"color: #d2d4b0\"><tt>But we will not let that happen, will we?</tt></span> <tt>I</tt> <span style=\"color: #d2d4b0\"><tt>am hoping this article does not block what I</tt></span> <tt>am</tt> <span style=\"color: #d2d4b0\"><tt>saying, but I need them to know it was</tt></span> <tt>not</tt> <span style=\"color: #d2d4b0\"><tt>who they thought it was, that it was not me.

    "description": "<p>The <strong>Entity 74</strong> \"Argos\", has not been observed so far by any <em>alive</em> operative of <a href=\"/the-m-e-g\">The M.E.G</a>, the only known subjects with direct evidence of his existence as well as the evidence itself disappeared, the information presented has been collected from various files that make reference to this mythical figure, for this reason it is noted that this entity may be being overestimated or <em>underestimated</em>.</p><br><p><strong>Entity 74</strong> has the appearance of a tall humanoid, who wears tactical clothing under a ragged black cloak and wields a strange spear. The origin of this entity like that many others is unknown, although its known that his antiquity dates back to at least 500 years, although it seems that even then he already possessed a large amount of knowledge about the Backrooms. Even so, the testimonies and evidence about his existence were very scarce, that is why it was thought that <strong>Argos</strong> was a legend, a mythological being created by the <a href=\"/the-eyes-of-argos\">Eyes of Argos</a>. This perspective changed after the events that occurred in the <strong>Log 1523</strong>. According to these reports, the entity <strong>Argos</strong> doesnt have any problem to move through the backrooms, so it can be found at almost all levels.</p><br><p><strong>Argos</strong> is the self-proclaimed judge of the Backrooms. Due to this he has taken the quest together with his subordinates to hunt down all the sinners that they can. He is brutal and so far <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">only one person is known to have managed to survive being chased by this entity</span> all his known prey have been killed / punished.</p><br><p>He is known to act according to a kind of code called \"The Law\" which is believed to have been written by himself. When someone performs a truly heinous action, <strong>Argos</strong> goes hunting to kill or punish this target, this also means that <strong>Argos</strong> is prohibited from killing someone who is \"innocent\" to his eyes (it is not known if this is due to his own nature or a self-imposed oath).</p><br><p>Very little is known about the operation of this entity, although it has a humanoid appearance, its capabilities surpass those of an ordinary human. Regarding his physical capabilities, he has increased stamina, speed and strength, In addition to this, his level of planning and strategic knowledge imply that he has an above-average intelligence, some reports also talk about how he seemed to ignore the pain and how his wounds healed faster than they should.</p><br><p>There is also reports of a \"True Vision\" that allows him to see through all kinds of deceptions and hallucinations. M.E.G Operative Paxton described it as \"if thousands of eyes were watching at him\", it is unknown if this ability has something to do with how <strong>Argos</strong> is able to detect sinners with relative precision, although it is what's believed.</p><br><p>For a long time the entity <strong>Argos</strong> and its \"knights of terror\" were a myth, a story that was told to newbies to scare them and control them a bit. Of course, the \"bad people\" disappeared little by little, because <strong>Argos</strong> was trying to stop the control. Everything was confirmed however, when [REDACTED] reached Base Omega, the events that this triggered are found in <strong>Log 1523</strong></p><br><p>In order to protect [REDACTED] from the Eyes of Argos, all information about him and his current position has been deleted.<br/></p><br><p><tt><strong>Interrogatory of the subject [REDACTED]</strong></tt><br/>\n<tt><strong>[12/03/20XX]</strong></tt><br/>\n<tt><strong>M.E.G Officer Miles</strong></tt></p><br><p><tt><strong>Miles:</strong> Calm down and let's start again, we are recording now.</tt></p><br><p><tt><strong>[REDACTED]:</strong> Pff \u2026 where do I start?</tt></p><br><p><tt><strong>Miles:</strong> Mhm, why dont you start with your <strong>Sin</strong>?</tt></p><br><p><tt><strong>[REDACTED]:</strong> M-my sin?</tt></p><br><p><tt><strong>Miles:</strong> Come on guy, we heard you screaming \"I'M NOT A SINNER!\" while you ran toward us.</tt></p><br><p><tt><strong>[REDACTED]:</strong> Oh well that\u2026 uhm yes I\u2026 I killed two guys, well I wouldn't say it was murder it was-</tt></p><br><p><tt><strong>Miles:</strong> You\u2026 killed two guys?</tt></p><br><p><tt><strong>[REDACTED]:</strong> Yes, I-I did it in self defense, I swear it!</tt></p><br><p><tt><strong>Miles:</strong> \"Day 16, i found another group, they are only two, this time should be easy\u2026\", I keep reading?</tt></p><br><p><tt><strong>[REDACTED]:</strong>Uhm, well, there is no reason to lie then</tt></p><br><p><tt><strong>Miles:</strong> We know what you did \u2026 7 murders huh, never thought I'd see anything like that.

Tell me about that <strong>man</strong></tt></p><br><p><tt><strong>[REDACTED]:</strong> Well this \u2026 it had been a few days I don't know, I was out there just wandering, planning what to do and after <em>that</em>, and suddenly I felt observed-</tt></p><br><p><tt><strong>Miles:</strong> Sorry, what level do you say you were at?</tt></p><br><p><tt><strong>[REDACTED]:</strong> Oh, yeah, on level two. The one with the white walls and-</tt></p><br><p><tt><strong>Miles:</strong> Yes, we know what level 2 is. Continue please.</tt></p><br><p><tt><strong>[REDACTED]:</strong> Yes sir! Okay, so you know that feeling right, you are alone and suddenly you have the need to turn back, many times there is nothing there, but this time, this time It was much worse, as if I was being watched from everywhere, thousands of eyes focused on me\u2026</tt></p><br><p><tt><strong>Miles:</strong> Do you need a break before continuing?</tt></p><br><p><tt><strong>[REDACTED]:</strong> Oh no, no, no, I can continue. So there he was, I thought I was going to see an army, but it was only one man. He was wearing a military suit, no, a tactical suit. I'm not sure because was wearing a cloak over it. I won't lie he looked amazing, like a ghost in the dark and then, when he walked the strips of his cloak-</tt></p><br><p><tt><strong>Miles:</strong> Focus please.</tt></p><br><p><tt><strong>[REDACTED]:</strong> Wait, I can show you, I- I have it right here \u2026 Oh, and I also recorded our conversation, only a part at least</tt></p><br><p><tt><strong>Miles:</strong> you WHAT?</tt></p><br><p><tt><strong>[REDACTED]:</strong> When you're close to death you think strange things, at least that's what people say.

Yeah, I just no-clipped through the floor and then I ended up in this level</tt></p><br><p><tt><strong>Miles:</strong> You\u2026 just no-clipped?</tt></p><br><p><tt><strong>[REDACTED]:</strong> Yes, just no-clipped! It seems that it misled him a bit because it took him a while to find me again, although by the time he did I was already very close to here!</tt></p><br><p><tt><strong>Miles:</strong> I don't believe anything you say, but that's all for today. We'll continue the interrogation tomorrow</tt></p><br><p><tt><strong>[REDACTED]</strong>: Continue with the interrogation?

    "description": "<p><strong>Wranglers</strong> are snake-like Entities that use their bodies to distract and confuse their prey in an almost hypnotic-like state. These Entities usually appear in cave areas like <a href=\"/level-669\">Level 669</a>, <a href=\"/level-52\">Level 52</a>, and <a href=\"/level-8\">Level 8</a>. Wranglers can also appear in damp areas like <a href=\"/level-2\">Level 2</a>, <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/level-2-1\">Level 2.1</a> and <a href=\"/level-14\">Level 14</a>. Reports show that wranglers have been spotted in <a href=\"/level-9\">Level 9</a>. These Entities are dangerous, and it is advised to stay away from them at all costs.</p><br><p>Wranglers are massive creatures that use their bodies to burrow through the ground for fast travel. Their bodies twist and turn in a drill-like motion to cut through the hard material of the Level. Their bodies can cause hypnotic effects on Wanderers to lure them in. They can use this ability to their advantage as a hunting tactic. When physically burrowing, wranglers are very loud, and one can hear them approaching. The appetite of a wrangler is very large, as they will eat anything in sight, including Wanderers.</p><br><p>The abilities of a wrangler vary depending on its sex and age. Males usually attack to eat and will consume anything its path. Females do not attack Wanderers and will usually retreat when noticed. They will instead eat vegetation or rock minerals. The females will, however, eat Wanderers when pregnant to feed their young. These eggs are seeds that grow on the female's body. Once the female lays the eggs, they are implanted in the ground or walls as a seed. These seeds will then sprout into a branch holding many different offspring. During this phase the female will return regularly to deliver food. Once the offspring outgrow their branch, they will break off from it and travel with the mother until they are old enough to live independently.</p><br><p>Young wranglers use their bodies to physically burrow. This tactic is abandoned once they get older, as the wrangler starts to No-Clip to burrow. They will eat anything their mother gives to them.</p><br><p>Wranglers are large snake-like creatures that can twist and contort their body in many ways. Their skin is moist and sticky. Their body is translucent, and the insides are visible, but as they get older, their skin will become grayer and more opaque. Their eyes glow a bright white which helps them to see through the dark. Their bodies are different depending on sex. Male wranglers will have a more human-like face and a broad smile, and their skin is rougher. Females will have a more worm-like look, with pincers where its mouth is. The length of an adult can go up from ten (10) to ninety (90) miles.</p><br><p>Wranglers were discovered when Wanderers were reporting large snake-like bodies extending from either side of a cavern or hall. This was further proven when a male wrangler attacked <a href=\"/the-m-e-g\">M.E.G.</a> Regiment \"Wild Warriors\" while on a mission to save a small outpost from <a href=\"/entity-8\">Hounds</a> on <a href=\"/level-2\">Level 2</a>. Since then, more sightings were being reported until, Eventually, an event on <a href=\"/level-8\">Level 8</a> had occurred.</p><br><p>Foreword: The following is detailing a large blockage in Level 8.</p><br><p><strong>Begin Log: 00:47</strong><br/>\n<strong>Interviewer:</strong> M.E.G. First Response Operator<br/>\n<strong>Interviewee:</strong> Unknown</p><br><p>Unknown: Hello?</p><br><p>M.E.G. Operator: Hello, this is \"First Response.\" What can I help you with?</p><br><p>Unknown: There's this large mass on Level 8. I've gone around the whole area. It's blocking it all off.</p><br><p>M.E.G. Operator: Ah, sir. That sounds like a wrangler.</p><br><p>Unknown: I don't care what it is. It's fucking blocking the only way out within miles.</p><br><p>M.E.G. Operator: Is it moving?</p><br><p>Unknown: No. The thing's dead. It looks halfway No-Clipped through the walls around it.</p><br><p>M.E.G. Operator: Did you say that it is blocking off multiple pathways?</p><br><p>Unknown: Yes. It's fucking ginormous.</p><br><p>M.E.G. Operator: I see, sir. We will be sending a team shortly. Please stay on hold.</p><br><p>Unknown: God damnit.</p><br><p><strong>End Log: 00:48</strong></p><br><p>The rest of this log will be an M.E.G. Team from Regiment \"Quick Match\" sent to investigate the situation.</p><br><p>They told me I have to keep a log of what is happening with the wrangler on Level 8. So. It's around midnight. Our squad is halfway to Level 8. We're being led by some weird guy whos appearance no one can agree on. He is silent and constantly writing. I have to admit. The fucker knows his way around here.</p><br><p>The time is around, I'd say 3 AM. We're in Level 8. Command says it's near an exit. I keep seeing baby Wranglers around. Stomp on everyone I see. The fuckers up at command supplied us with Pyroil and matches. They told us to stay vigilant.</p><br><p>It's 7 AM. We found it. It's a wrangler, and it's dead. The thing's huge. This thing is old, ancient. We went around the entire area, and it's everywhere. This thing is a tunnel on the inside; that's how large it is. I can vaguely make out skeletons and other shit inside of it. Pyroil won't burn this fucker. We need a goddamn firesalt launcher for this. This thing stretches for miles. Parts of the caves are clipping through this thing. It's fucking strange. The command doesn't believe us. They say that one can't grow that big.</p><br><p>A second team arrived with more Pyroil. We finally burnt a path to the exit. The guy that contacted us got through. However, there was some weird shit in here. From old guns and skeletons to undiscovered shit. We need to clear out the rest on our next trip. We are on our way back to base.</p><br><p>December 17th, 2019, 12:30 AM. A large, deceased occurrence of Entity 75 has been found in Level 8. It was discovered after an unknown wanderer reported it to M.E.G. Team \"First Response.\" A team was promptly sent and took 7 hours to get to the location with the help of M.E.G Operative 'Dzer'. These operatives tried burning a path to the exit. However, not enough Pyroil was supplied. A second-team arrived with more supplies. This allowed a path to be burnt through the Entity. At a later date, the rest was burnt away\u2014the amount totaling to 2 cubic miles.</p><br><p>This anomaly is an old male wrangler and it's the biggest wrangler, possibly the largest Entity recorded. Many public cavern systems in Level 8 have been blocked off by a mass of decaying plant-like flesh of a wrangler. The wrangler died during No-Clip Burrow. It seems to have died of starvation. The number of skeletons and indigestible objects found in here was considerable. These skeletons belong to some unknown entities. Some human-made objects and other essential supplies were found. Other mysterious objects were found as well. <a href=\"/the-m-e-g\">The M.E.G.</a> have sent back-up teams of Regiment \"Quick Match\" to help the Wanderers trapped in the caverns of Level 8 due to the large wrangler corpse.</p><br><p>The original authors of this entry is <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/stretchsterz\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6287336); return false;\"><img alt=\"Stretchsterz\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=6287336&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1731456201\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=6287336)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/stretchsterz\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6287336); return false;\">Stretchsterz</a></span> and avertexpert.</p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:70%;\">Author Page Code is definitely not from Birch.

It is so worn out that squeezing it will result in no noise coming from it. On the bottom of the duck is a name, which says \"Robert, I miss you.\", which is impossible to wash off for some reason. Due to this note on the bottom, he was named \"Robert\".</p><br><p>The duck shows much importance to one who uses it, though the real reason why or how remains completely unknown.</p><br><p><span class=\"note\">A- Wha\u2026 what?

Seriously?</span> Entity 76 has a poorly drawn note on the bottom of the duck that states \"Robert, I miss you, keep this present to remember me by.\" <span class=\"note\">How would you even have the space to put that there? This is confusing as hell.</span> The duck's appearance looks very normal, excluding the fact that it is wearing a tuxedo with a top hat. <span class=\"note\">A goddamn top hat, of course.</span> The duck also goes by names, which include Ducc, Robert J. Quack, Robert, and The Duck.</p><br><p>Along with thi, <span class=\"note\">Can't even spell \"this\" correctly?</span> Entity 76 gives random thoughts at random times to people who interact with the duck. <span class=\"note\">What! This makes no goddamn sense. It's a duck\u2026 with a note on it\u2026 and it gives people random thoughts..?</span> For example, the duck has given people many thoughts, ideas, and goals to accomplish, even showing new levels, entrance and exits to existing levels, and other important information. <span class=\"note\">Can you specify? What levels it shown? Nope, of course you won't.</span></p><br><p>Despite it being a rubber duck, he is very formal and straightforward in conversations and actions. <span class=\"note\">It talks. Of course.</span> He works at a rubber duck store at a mall, though would love to work as a detective. <span class=\"note\">Rubber duck store!? Detective!?</span> He even has a \"song\":</p><br><p>The best detective <em>(The best detective)</em><br/>\nOh oh oh\u2014<br/>\nI am the one <em>(The one)</em><br/>\nOne of a kind!<br/>\nI'm Robert, and I'm super-</p><br><p>The rest of the page is torn off. <span class=\"note\">What.</span></p><br><p>Entity 76 is very similar, in appearance, to a standardized rubber duck. The duck has a black tuxedo with a white bowtie, and a black top hat. The duck also has a large, orange beak and a overall happy expression on his face. The duck is 5 inches tall, and 3 inches wide. <span class=\"note\">Why is it just partially restating the same exact things?</span></p><br><p>The abilities of the duck include giving random thoughts to people who are nearby it, teleportation, intelligence, capability of speech, and advanced problem solving.</p><br><p>It is unknown when Entity 76 was discovered.</p><br><p><span class=\"note\">What the hell is this!? Is David pulling some joke on me? The duck doesn't even make sense. I mean, I could try to find \"David\"? I'll try to communicate with some operatives, hopefully get this stupid object deleted.

Weird. The stupid entry also manually removed my messages in the black text. They will probably delete this one too.

But it's from an actual guy, and I can actually see who created it. It's an M.E.G. Operative.. I'll just read this myself.</span></p><br><p>Object 69, or \"The Sentient Duck\", \"Rubber Duck\", or its preferred name, \"Robert J. Quack\", is a 2x5 duck who brings thoughts and emotions to one who interacts with it. Whether or not the duck is an entity or object has been debated, due to its sentient appearance and overall entity-like behavior.</p><br><p>The duck resembles that of a normal, cheap rubber duck with a black tuxedo, white bowtie, a black top hat covering the entire duck's upper forehead, and an almost hood like object covering the entire backside of the duck's head. The duck has thick black eyebrows with chipped yellow paint from all directions. The eyes, however, are in a roughly good condition. On the lower back of the duck shows what looks like feathers poorly modelled and painted on, with more black paint coming from the tuxedo and some worn off paint.</p><br><p>The properties of this duck are very interesting and unique. Some properties include: intelligence, capability of speech, basic and advanced problem solving, and transporting thoughts, goals, emotions, and information to the human mind. How these are achievable, especially from a rubber duck, is unknown. The intelligence of the rubber duck is around the average IQ of a human, and therefore has the intelligence to speak. However, it only speaks via a text-to-speech robot, virtual messages, and letters. The duck can also accomplish basic tasks, and can do certain advanced tasks as well. The most notable and useful property it can do is the ability to send thoughts to the human min\u2014</p><br><p>But you already know this story\u2026 don't you?</p><br><p>Let me grab a chatterbox, therefor we can discuss this for hours on end!</p><br><p><span class=\"note\">The hell!?</span></p><br><p>M.E.G.

That's when I entered The Non-Euclidian! And I have indeed became the greatest detective in all of the land!</p><br><p><strong>M.E.G.

I miss him dearly. *Quack*</p><br><p><strong>M.E.G. Operative:</strong> Well, I'm sorry Mr. Robert but we do not know of this Jimmy you have mentioned.</p><br><p><strong>Robert:</strong> Oh.. Well, I guess this is a question that must be answered another time. Very well then!</p><br><p><strong>M.E.G.

Quack decided to help in favor of The M.E.G. and has grown to become one of their biggest and most proudest members. We gave him a place to stay in Storage-02 and soon turned it into his home. Eventually becoming Overseer-D. We are grateful to have such an amazing leader and we hope to continue to have his acquittance in The M.E.G. for the foreseen future.</p><br><p><span class=\"note\">Okay, I'm tired of this, it said that Storage-02 was its new renovated home, which I was just there yesterday and it's just a storage room.

Quack is a duck that was once in a rough condition, but now in newer and overall more healthy manner ordered by Overseer-A. Overseer-D is very intelligent, capable of speech (Even though he has the appearance of a duck), and brings random ideas and thoughts to others (See below for more details). Fortunately, he has used his powers for good, and tries to give a helping hand to The M.E.G. and our works.</p><br><p>Overseer-D has many abilities, which include intelligence, capability of writing letters and typing out messages, and it is able to give thoughts and ideas to the human brain. How any of these properties and abilities are even possible is unknown.</p><br><p>Overseer-D is very kind and caring for his operatives and members, and will help them in need for almost every situation. Though Overseer-D hasn't gotten a real thing to focus on (Like the other Overseers), he will attempt to help on what he can.</p><br><p>Overseer-D's personality is very formal and serious, but caring. Despite Overseer-D's very little information about his backstory, he will still answer questions and participate in interviews.</p><br><p>Overseer-D resembles a 2x5 rubber duck.<span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">The duck is in a rough condition with paint almost scratched off or almost \"mixed\" together. The duck has a rough black suit and white tie, with that same dirty paint. The hat and almost hood like cover surrounding the back of Overseer-D's head looks notably different to the rest of the dirty suit, and looks relatively clean. The duck's face also has the same dirty look.</span> Due to Overseer-A's demands to clean Overseer-D, he now looks much better and healthy.</p><br><p>Overseer-D's actual abilities are largely unknown, but do not seem to be a danger to anybody for now. Overseer-D has the intelligence and IQ of an average human, even completing an IQ test and getting the IQ of 120. Overseer-D cannot speak, and can only communicate via letters and online messages. Even though it cannot speak formerly, it is still unknown how Overseer-D can write/type messages. Lastly he can give thoughts and ideas to the brain of a person who is in a certain radius. Overseer-D himself said he cannot control what thoughts and ideas can be given, and so far most of the information given has been useless. However, some information has revealed entrances and exits of pre-existing levels, and even vague, and rarely, vivid descriptions of undiscovered levels.</p><br><p>Overseer-D apparently has an entire complex origin story, though has been only been glazed over by him. He apparently used to work at a rubber duck store, named \"The Duck Superstore\", which was later found within <a href=\"/level-33\">Level 33</a>. Later he then joined The M.E.G. and became Overseer-D fairly quickly due to his amazing skills as a M.E.G. Operative. Important figures in his life was his wife named \"Milda\" and a person Overseer-D is trying to find named \"Jimmy\". Both of these figures have never been seen or talked to.</p><br><p>Robert J. Quack was found when M.E.G. Database Staff Member 'Joshua Mills' was found in a fetal position sobbing while being contained in a crate in Storage-02 inside Base Omega. Robert was found on top of said crate. He was then rescued and placed in a new living space in Base Omega.</p><br><p><strong>Begin Log: 07:15</strong><br/>\n<strong>Interviewer:</strong> M.E.G.

Operative:</strong> Is\u2026 Is he alive?</p><br><p><strong>End Log: 07:24</strong></p><br><p><strong>Summary:</strong> During this time, Joshua had experienced many warped deformities before turning into multiple rubber ducks. The remaining ducks were put into a plastic bin with Joshua's name labeled on it incase we find a way to bring him back. Soon after, Joshua's Office had been found warped beyond repair. Luckily Robert was there to quickly patch up these oddities. Since this event, we had made a large room full of supplies for Robert to live inside of Base Omega where he will remain happy.

    "description": "<p><strong>The Dreamweaver</strong> is a Non-Physical Entity that you can discover while dreaming in The Backrooms or while finding the Dreamcatcher. This Entity is an observer and does not engage in a hostile manner, although, it can engage in your dreams in other ways through a number of passive abilities. This Entity can do things such as alter your dream, give you dreams and even cause hallucinations. <strong>The Dreamweaver</strong> could be extremely dangerous if it were able to use its abilities for hostile activity.</p><br><p><strong>The Dreamweaver</strong> rarely appears in dreams and seems to come in random intervals - but is more encouraged to appear when interacting with the Dreamcatcher. This is an object that will cause many effects to the human body including an instantaneous sleep-like stasis that will cause you to dream and attract this Entity. <strong>The Dreamweaver</strong> will be unnoticeable once in your dream, and will then manipulate your dreams in strange and challenging ways. Soon you will be able to spot <strong>The Dreamweaver</strong> in different areas of your dream wandering around and disappearing, all while staring at you.</p><br><p><strong>The Dreamweaver</strong> feeds on the fear of a wanderer, so actively weakens the dreamers mental state to feed off their energy. For the user to be awoken they'll need to escape the dream through strange means that are completely random, to running from a pack of wolves, to simply eating a bowl of cereal for example. The user will be asleep until the user escapes the Entity in the dream, and successfully fought off the Entity. In the Event of the user escaping, <strong>The Dreamweaver</strong> will still lurk around the corners of your vision in reality for weeks. This Entity can cause further hallucinations to the user and warp reality to the Entity's will if needed although this instance of reality manipulation via hallucinations is very rare. This Entity will further wearing down a victim's mental state from there, including decreased hunger, water and sleep effects of The Backrooms, as the user will constantly need to eat, drink and sleep. <strong>The Dreamweaver</strong> will have lasting effects for an amount of days that usually contain weeks.</p><br><p><strong>The Dreamweaver</strong> is around eight (8) feet tall, and has a skinny skeletal structure, with black charcoal-like skin that looks as if the Entity's entire body was burnt. <strong>The Dreamweaver</strong> has long appendages protruding from the top of its skull, flowing to the back of its head, similar to a jester hat. It has sharp claws with webbed hands and feet. Its feet have three (3) toes with claws sprouting from them. <strong>The Dreamweaver</strong>'s face is long and wide as it has a huge grinning smile. Its lips crispy red as it seems to be flaking and peeling. The Entity's teeth are enormous and sharp in a grinning style. Its eyes glow yellow and are similar to those of a lizard, with eyelids over the top-half of its eyes.</p><br><p><strong>The Dreamweaver</strong> when close, makes a deep purring to growling noise at the user while grinning and smiling. The Entity's body when walking is hunched-over and walks in a slow manner. As it walks it will stare at you through the corners of where it has appeared until eventually disappearing around a corner. <strong>The Dreamweaver</strong> has the ability to crawl and stick to any surface, but this Entity is usually seen walking.</p><br><p><strong>The Dreamweaver</strong> was once a myth as it was only able to appear in dreams. This all was changed when our own members started to slowly go insane as they are describing that this creature haunt's their dreams and mind. Soon after, M.E.G. Regiment Quick Match \"Fireflies\" was sent out to aid a group of Wanderers to terminate a hostile Entity. During the mission the Team stumbled upon the Dreamcatcher and had gotten into a deep sleep-like stasis . The Team was put under the aid of M.E.G. Regiment Life Line \"Mossy Medics\" to ensure the safety of their health. Fireflies are now normal and back on duty.</p><br><p>This Entity is still under investigation and testing and we will update this Entry once we have concluded our studies.</p><br><p>This Interrogation Log is about an M.E.G. member of Team \"Volunteer Squad\" that wishes to stay anonymous had an encounter with <strong>The Dreamweaver</strong>. An M.E.G. Officer has started the following Log:</p><br><p><strong>Begin Log: 12:29</strong><br/>\n<strong>Interviewer:</strong> M.E.G. Officer<br/>\n<strong>Interviewee:</strong> Wanderer</p><br><p><strong>M.E.G. Officer:</strong> We would normally want you to state your name for the interview but you want to remain anonymous and we respect that decision. Please elaborate on your experience.</p><br><p><strong>Wanderer:</strong> I.. It was just a normal day for this place. I've been here or Four Years, I know what to expect here but this\u2026 It was horrible, I couldn't escape for an entire two (2) days of me asleep.</p><br><p><strong>M.E.G. Officer:</strong> It is a pretty horrible situation. May you please elaborate on the following Events?</p><br><p><strong>Wanderer:</strong> It was just\u2026 Me, at my old house\u2026 Back home\u2026 as I always dream about. But this was different, nobody was there. It was just me\u2026 Alone\u2026 Or that was just how it felt.</p><br><p><em>(The Wanderer slowly starts shaking)</em></p><br><p><strong>M.E.G. Officer:</strong> Please, stay calm and continue the explanation.</p><br><p><strong>Wanderer:</strong> Right. I was walking around my house, and I'd see open halls and stuff like that, I had a pretty big house as a kid. Me and my brother would just get lost in what felt like a maze in our own home. This reminded me of that. But\u2026 I soon realized I wasn't alone. As I looked at the door to the right of me, to my parent's room, I see it open. I see\u2026 It\u2026</p><br><p><strong>M.E.G. Officer:</strong> Continue.</p><br><p><strong>Wanderer:</strong> It was there looking at me with its large smile as it walked slowly across the door frame until I couldn't see it. I panicked and ran, I thought I had to get out of there. Then I noticed it was a dream but\u2026 I couldn't wake up\u2026 I was\u2026 Stuck\u2026</p><br><p><strong>M.E.G. Officer:</strong> Please explain what you mean by stuck.</p><br><p><strong>Wanderer:</strong> I couldn't get out of my dream and wake up. I was stuck in my dream. I wen't outside of the house and ran everywhere\u2026 But there was no life, clear as day\u2026 And no one in sight\u2026 I ran into buildings and more buildings\u2026 But every building was my house on the inside, I couldn't escape it. It was just\u2026 So quiet\u2026 I found a local store I always hanged around in when I was a kid with my friends. I went inside and saw no one there. The place always had a creepy storage basement in the building that always made creaky noises and stuff, me and my friends would joke around about it, but we never went inside once\u2026 I was scared of it, but the owner of the store brought me down and shown me there was nothing to be afraid of. But this\u2026 was different. The door opened\u2026 Slowly\u2026 Creaking as it does\u2026 I went to look through the doorway. All I saw was the light above me shining on the wooden stairway below me. The rest was darkness\u2026 Then I hear movement down there\u2026 I couldn't move. I was there for what felt like minutes\u2026 Frozen\u2026 until I saw a yellow glow of what looked like eyes\u2026 It was getting closer\u2026 Closer\u2026 Until I saw it's hand stretch from the darkness to grab onto the railing on the side of the wall, its hand making a crispy crunching noise as it grabbed the railing which it made a dent in with a metallic screech. it's face was so close to me but I couldn't see it yet\u2026 Until it got even closer. It was there\u2026 Its face slowly revealing itself as the echos of it's slow purr filled my ears. As the light of the lamp above me shined on it's horrifying face\u2026 Staring at me\u2026 The creak of every step it took\u2026 I\u2026 I COULDN'T TAKE IT!</p><br><p><strong>M.E.G. Officer:</strong> Please calm down, there is no need to panic here, we'll bring you some <a href=\"/object-1\">Almond Water</a> for you if you need it.</p><br><p><strong>Wanderer:</strong> IT WAS EVERYWHERE I WENT IN! EVERY CORNER I LOOKED I WOULD SEE IT! I HAVEN'T GOTTEN SLEEP FOR WEEKS! I CAN SEE IT WHEN I CLOSE MY EYES IT'S IN Y FACE! IT'S EVERYWHERE I LOOK EVEN RIGHT NOW! IT'S RIGHT BEHIND YOU!</p><br><p><strong>M.E.G. Officer:</strong>. Please calm yourself, we are retrieving <a href=\"/object-1\">Almond Water</a> for you at this very moment, please be patient an-</p><br><p><em>(A muffled scream can be heard from the M.E.G.

    "title": "- \"Chrono-Wisps\"",
    "description": "<p><strong>Chrono-Wisps</strong> are rare, almost transparent entities resembling glowing concentrations of mist that float through the Backrooms with an ethereal grace. These entities possess the ability to cause temporal anomalies within the confined spaces of the Backrooms. Wanderers describe encounters with the <strong>Chrono-Wisps</strong> as surreal experiences involving sudden shifts in perception, witnessing glimpses of both past and future, and feeling boundaries of time blur as if the walls of reality become fluid in their presence.</p><br><p><strong>Chrono-Wisps</strong> are capable of accessing a threatening wanderer or entity's mind to trap them in a time loop, though it's rare for them to resort to this defense mechanism. The victim will be forced to relive the last minute for what feels like hours to even weeks with no control over their body, whilst externally almost no time passes. Another defense mechanism they have is the ability to force wanderers to relive some of their most traumatic memories. Though these memories feel like They last for a couple minutes, several days can pass externally, which causes wanderers to succumb to dehydration and starvation. This is commonly the fate of wanderers who ignore warnings and go out searching for Chrono-Wisps to satisfy cravings brought on by the phenomenon associated with this entity.</p><br><p>Despite this, there are some characteristics that still attract attention to <strong>Chrono-Wisps</strong>, like their beautiful and disconcerting appearance often described by wanderers. The frequent sense of timelessness during these encounters gives rise to a sensation both liberating and unsettling - a phenomenon dubbed \u201cChronobliss\u201d. The effects of Chronobliss are addicting to many wanderers for many different reasons, the most prominent being because of the way that Chronobliss changes the way wanderers perceive time. Instead of it being linear and fleeting, time feels malleable and plenty. Chronobliss has a way of making wanderers enter a timeless state where one minute feels like forever, at least until the effect ends, which appeals to wanderers as many fear that death is always around the corner. This effect can take over even the strongest of minds and replace all reasonable thought and feeling with immutable desire. People affected by this addiction often lose focus, forget simple things, and don't recognize loved ones.</p><br><p>Being under the effect of Chronobliss for extended periods of time can cause wanderers or even entities to enter a truly timeless state where every second can feel like an eternity. This reaction is rare, horrifying, and causes wanderers to lose their sense of self. Wanderers in this condition are often found lying with their bodies contorted in unnatural positions, having several bones broken and muscles torn. Despite this wanderers in this state don't feel any pain. Nobody has ever recovered from this condition, with most patients dying within a year. It is believed that similar to the time loop defense mechanism, wanderers under this effect are trapped inside their own minds. For the final few months, an affected wanderer will become increasingly less reactant to touch. For the last few weeks a wanderer has, they will further lose understanding of spatial awareness and become even less receptive to any visual or auditory stimuli. Finally, for the last few days a wanderer has, their parietal lobe will be almost completely dysfunctional, rendering them almost unresponsive to all kinds of sensory information.</p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p><br><p><strong>Chrono-Wisps</strong> are often seen floating slowly, graciously, and almost aimlessly through the many corridors of the Backrooms. Wanderers frequently confuse this behavior for the <strong>Chrono-Wisps</strong> trying to lead them somewhere and will follow them, which has on numerous occasions caused the entity to feel threatened enough to use their defense mechanisms. <strong>Chrono-Wisps</strong> prefer levels with very little human development and activity, and will often disappear from levels that begin to grow in human population. <strong>Chrono-Wisps</strong> are usually very passive and simply pass by wanderers and entities. When they encounter others of their species they always stop for a minute or two before continuing on through.</p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p><br><p>It is impossible to study the biology of <strong>Chrono-Wisps</strong> as no groups yet have the technology to contain their reality-bending nature and unusual form. Attempts to collect samples of the entity have all failed as the entity can just float through any barrier it is contained in. It is debated exactly how intelligent <strong>Chrono-Wisps</strong> are, but a majority believe that they are highly intelligent or even omniscient because of the way the entity accesses a wanderer's mind and memories.</p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p><br><p>The first recorded encounter with <strong>Chrono-Wisps</strong> was on December 15th, 1999 by wanderer Alistair Rose. He was found curled up and contorted in a fetal position, heavily under the influence of Chronobliss. At first, it was believed that the thing he encountered was not in fact an entity, but after several subsequent sightings it was determined otherwise.</p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/entity-78\">Entity 78</a>\" by Ravio42, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

    "description": "<p>Becoming an instance of Entity 79 or a \"Wanderer\" is the seemingly inevitable fate of <a href=\"/entity-1\">humans</a> who consume <a href=\"/object-1\">Almond Water</a>. Like the <a href=\"/entity-15\">Wretched Cycle</a>, there are a number of ways to slow down the transformation, such as a diverse diet. Theoretically, the only way to completely avoid turning into a Wanderer is avoid Almond Water completely, but due to its properties, it is all but impossible to drink at least once.</p><br><p>A group of humans in the early stages of becoming Wanderers. It's not until the transformation is complete that people avoid being in groups.</p><br><p>Being \"born\" from humans, there are very few physical tells that distinguish a Wanderer from a wanderer. However, if you see a human whose eyes tend to reflect light in dark areas<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup>, they are probably a Wanderer.</p><br><p>Wanderers are a neutral species. They will not attack unless cornered, preferring to flee by running or <a href=\"/phenomenon-5\">no-clipping</a> away. Despite coming from a social species, Wanderers are solitary, preferring not to be in groups larger than two or three people. In addition, their \"society\" is purely transactional and has no concept of altruism, requiring a trade before doing any sort of service, such as answering questions, guiding humans through a level, or even saving someone while in danger. Unless they are offered a trade of some sort, Wanderers will stand by and watch someone die. Trading with a Wanderer can be tricky, but they will accept any item they deem useful or are personally interested in as well as pay back any \"life debts\" that may they have incurred.</p><br><p>Below are the most common trades Wanderers perform:</p><br><p>It is interesting to note that Wanderers do not completely lose their identities from when they were human. They have a desire for \"items of interest\" that serve no purpose except for sentimental value, such as odd trinkets or photographs from when they were human. These items can be used to barter, but their value will change from Wanderer to Wanderer. A trinket that is valuable to one Wanderer may be worthless to another. For this reason, it is good practice to have a bottle of Almond Water ready to trade.</p><br><p>While most Wanderers will not attack, it is not the same for children who have turned into Wanderers. Their behavior is more unpredictable, presumably because of the lack of emotional development before changing. Because of this, child Wanderers tend to have more extreme behavior as well as trades that don't make sense (such as giving aid in exchange for seeing a silly dance). They are more likely to engage in threatening behavior because it amuses them. If you see a lone child in the Backrooms, approach with caution.</p><br><p>Autopsies show that there are very few biological differences between Wanderers and humans except for 4 key things: an unusually small stomach, an enlarged liver, increased lean tissue mass, and tapetum lucidum being present in the eyes.</p><br><p>Interestingly, Wanderers show a lack of desire to eat, preferring in all circumstances to drink Almond Water. While Wanderers are capable of eating small amounts of food, it does not seem to sustain them as well as Almond Water and is only partially digested, as seen from the examination of Wanderer excrement.</p><br><p>The connection between Wanderers and Almond Water is more than it being their main source of nutrition. It is how they are born. Generally, the more Almond Water a human drinks, the quicker their transformation is into a Wanderer. Humans who drink nothing but Almond Water tend to transform into Wanderers after 1 year of being in the Backrooms. Those who have been able to find regular food and water and supplement their diets with Almond Water tend to change after 5-10 years. Only those who have very sparingly touched Almond Water seem to be free from the change.</p><br><p>There are other factors that determine how rapidly a human changes into a Wanderer, but consumption of Almond Water is the main determining factor. For example, the frequency of how often one explores the Backrooms is an additional risk factor for a quicker transformation, but it may be because of the tendency of explorers to travel lightly and bring only Almond Water to sustain them.</p><br><p>Presumably, since there have been humans in the Backrooms, there have been Wanderers. There is no written evidence, but the amount of abandoned human encampments and the relative age of these encampments indicates the presence of Wanderers.</p><br><p>However, their main discovery came from what is now known as the \"Mass Desertion Event\" (MDE). Across countless levels, multiple M.E.G. leaders and members deserted their posts, leaving many outposts and research labs without leadership and information.</p><br><p><span class=\"titlebox\">MDE Interview #5 - Marcus Brandt</span><br/>\nIt was like, crazy. They<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup> just up and left, man. It was fine for a bit. People still did their jobs. Cassie continued to get food, Brian kept the comms running. I just kept walking around, on patrol ya know. But it was weird. Everyone was tense. Felt like we were waiting for the teacher to come back. But those guys never did.</p><br><p>Most outposts recovered quickly. However, it was more specialized M.E.G. outposts and research labs that suffered the most, with the loss of institutional knowledge heavily impacting projects, research, and other things of interest to the M.E.G.</p><br><p><span class=\"titlebox\">MDE Interview #9 - Maddie Martin</span><br/>\nOh, god. I don't even want to think about it. Warren left so many unfinished projects, I don't know what to do with them. There's something going on with mold, something to do with hydroponics and Almond Water. Oh, and the one with Liquid Silence or whatever it is. These are just the ones I remember.</p><br><p>It took us ages to find his notes, then pick the safe he stored them in, and <em>then</em> it took even longer to decipher that guy's handwriting! The Overseers were panicking a bit, thinking he had a project that dealt with the <a href=\"/entity-19\">Disease,</a> but thankfully, he didn't have one.</p><br><p>\u2026Okay, it was more like we couldn't find a record of one. Is it possible that he has a vial of the Disease around, floating around in the Backrooms? I\u2026 don't want to think about it.</p><br><p>Look, I got my bachelor's in geology. I deal with rocks. I know that the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell, but that's pretty much all I know about biology. I can manage the lab alright, get some projects going again, but until we get another biologist, his stuff is just going to sit in storage.</p><br><p>However, nothing compared to the MDE on hospitals.</p><br><p><span class=\"titlebox\">MDE Interview #13 - Gwen Callahan</span><br/>\nFuck. Them<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')\">3</a></sup>.</p><br><p>That's all I'm going to say. I don't care who you think you are or what the <em>fuck</em> you're going through. You don't fucking leave in the middle of your shift! You don't leave volunteers floundering, and you sure as hell don't leave a patient bleeding out on the hospital floor!</p><br><p>That asswipe left in the middle of surgery. They just\u2026 left, leaving that poor woman's leg open. Because of that <em>fucker</em>, she died! If I see them again\u2026well, it'll make a Hound attack look like nothing.</p><br><p>Months later, Doctor Rohan Daniels was found wandering <a href=\"/level-540\">Level 540</a>. They were cordial, but would not answer any questions until they were given a package of matches.</p><br><p><span class=\"titlebox\">Interview with Doctor Daniels by Erik Corbel</span><br/>\n<strong>Corbel:</strong> Thanks for sticking around Doc. 'ppreciate it.</p><br><p><strong>Daniels:</strong> Mhm.</p><br><p><strong>Corbel:</strong> So why'd you do it? Why'd you leave?</p><br><p><strong>Daniels:</strong> Oh, because I wanted to.</p><br><p><strong>Corbel:</strong> \u2026What?</p><br><p><strong>Daniels:</strong> I'm confused. Was my answer not clear? I didn't want to be in <a href=\"/level-11\">Level 11</a> anymore. So I left. Don't see how that could be confusing.</p><br><p>[Daniels abruptly turns and begins to walk off. Corbel chases after them.]</p><br><p><strong>Corbel:</strong> W-wait! I have more questions. Just answer one more! Please! Uh, I'll give you\u2026 my coat? My phone? This bottle of Almond Water?</p><br><p>[Daniels stops, turns, and holds out their hand for the Almond Water.]</p><br><p><strong>Corbel:</strong> Okay, only have one question I guess\u2026 So why'd didn't you finish the surgery, the one you were doing before you left?</p><br><p><strong>Daniels:</strong> Ah, I came to a realization. In this place, altruism is a trap. To care for other people bogs you down, keeps you stuck to one place. And for what? Gratitude? The camaraderie of the human spirit? What worth do those have if I'm dead? They are empty emotions, ones that are inherently selfish. If the M.E.G. were truly grateful for my services or truly cared about us sticking together, would I not receive something from them, something of equal value? Should my patients not give me recompense for my services? That woman had nothing for me, so there is no reason for me to care whether she lives or dies. The only person I can truly count on is myself. Anyone else is a burden and will only lower my chances of surviving the Backrooms.</p><br><p>[Daniels dips their head to Corbel before walking off.]</p><br><p><strong>Daniels:</strong> I hope your question has been answered. Thank you for the Almond Water.</p><br><p>Additionally, very few social bonds survive the transformation into a Wanderer. As stated before, Wanderer society is purely transactional and solitary, with little need for interaction. Though they have reproductive organs, few Wanderers engage in procreation, and even fewer have children, human or otherwise. Presumably, children offer no benefit to them, and therefore, are considered burdens.</p><br><p><span class=\"titlebox\">MDE Interview #25 - Rosario Candela</span><br/>\nI just\u2026 It's hard. Children aren't stupid. They pick up on more than we think. They're always watching us, learning. And they <em>rely</em> on us to protect them, to guide them, to love them!</p><br><p>So how do I explain that their parents don't want them anymore?</p><br><p>The mass departure required the M.E.G. to drastically change how it stored information. Security was exchanged for accessibility, and all documents required extensive documentation, enough that complete amateurs could easily pick up where others started.</p><br><p>It is advised that parents and guardians set up an extensive network of potential guardians for their children in case they become a Wanderer. The M.E.G. has set up a network of orphanages across <a href=\"/level-11\">Level 11</a> and <a href=\"/level-1\">Level 1</a>.</p><br><p>In addition, finding consistent, alternate forms of sustenance to Almond Water became a priority of the Overseers. The wheat fields of <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-10\">Level 10</a> seemed a likely candidate, but due to the properties of the wheat, harvesting was quickly abandoned. The M.E.G. have yet to find an easily-replenished form of food for large communities aside from Almond Water. While <a href=\"/object-28\">Lucky 'O Milk</a> and <a href=\"/object-16\">Royal Rations</a> have been investigated as alternate food sources, they have no noticeable effect on slowing or stopping the transformation.</p><br><p><span class=\"titlebox\">Excerpt from <em>Almond Water: Panacea or Poison?</em></span><br/>\n\"Almond Water is considered a miracle drink for many reasons. It being a complete source of nutrition as well as the mental effects it has on stopping the Wretched Cycle makes it a must-have supply in the Backrooms. However, with the discovery of another transformation caused by the consumption of Almond Water, the M.E.G. should reconsider whether it is 'safe.' After all, what is the point of surviving if you're no longer human?\"</p><br><p>- Sergei Mahavir</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/entity-79\">Entity 79</a>\" by BlueSignet, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

These buttons correspond to their respective levels<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup>, and upon pressing them, the <strong>elevator</strong> will immediately begin rising or descending into the selected level.</p><br><p>In the case of unnumbered levels, the buttons corresponding to them will be labeled with two to three letters each; these letters are merely abbreviations for the names of unnumbered levels. To find a comprehensive list of abbreviations, please contact an <a href=\"/the-m-e-g\">M.E.G.</a> archivist.</p><br><p><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">All <strong>elevators</strong> are completely safe.</span> <span style=\"color: red\">See addendum.</span></p><br><p>Many instances of <strong>Entity 81</strong> are perfectly fluent in all aspects of every language used both in <a href=\"/the-frontrooms\">the Frontrooms</a> and the Backrooms, including dead languages. As such, they can communicate with wanderers both vocally and via a small TV-like screen positioned haphazardly inside the <strong>elevator</strong>. What they choose to talk about heavily depends on the wanderer's mood and/or interests.</p><br><p>Due to these behaviours, many believe that all <strong>elevators</strong> are sentient.</p><br><p>A pair of deluxe elevators in <a href=\"/level-122\">Level 122</a>.</p><br><p><strong>Elevators</strong> tend to vary in design depending on the level they are in. For example, an <strong>elevator</strong> in <a href=\"/level-5\">Level 5</a> will often be incredibly beautiful and neat, while the same <strong>elevator</strong> entering <a href=\"/level-485\">Level 485</a> will appear very dirty and overrun with dirt, mold, and other unwanted substances.</p><br><p>The original discovery of <strong>Entity 81</strong> is still yet to be determined, as it has been confirmed that the entity was discovered long before the founding of <a href=\"/the-m-e-g\">the M.E.G.</a>, or any major group of interest, for that matter. However, wanderers have used instances of <strong>Entity 81</strong> to discover other levels, such as <a href=\"/level-224\">Level 224</a>.</p><br><p>Hey uh. I'm pretty sure that these witness accounts don't need to be all that formal, I think\u2026? Whatever. I'll just keep writing in this personal tone.</p><br><p>I'm Mason Martinez<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')\">3</a></sup>, and although I'm not associated with any major group, I do have a giant group of friends. We mainly just like to run around the Backrooms looking for food, water, and whatnot. And of course, we would almost always use elevators to travel through levels, because as their article states, they are EXTREMELY useful.</p><br><p>Yeah\u2026 that is, until a bit recently. Three of us, including myself, have encountered several instances of these things being straight up deadly. Well\u2026 actually, I think \"deadly\" is a bit too much of an exaggeration. One of my friends and I were somewhat fine, while the other one has been in a hospital for about a week now. So here's what happened:</p><br><p>I was in <a href=\"/level-522\">Level 522</a> buying some items I needed. I finished my business and began searching for an exit as usual. During my search, I found this one elevator with this sign saying \"Out of order\". Here's an image of it, for reference:</p><br><p>Me, being the elevator junkie I am, decided to ignore it and pry the door open. When I did, however, it unleashed this HUGE infestation of centipedes, millipedes, fire ants, <a href=\"/entity-49\">combines</a>, and more crazy bugs I couldn't identify. I did manage to run away fast, but not before one of the fire ants bit me really damn hard. I had to waste what was left of my first aid kit, but now I'm fine. Furthermore, the owners of the level taped the elevator off and put up a bunch of signs advising against its usage, so I guess that's good.</p><br><p>Next, my first friend (I'm gonna call him Ben due to privacy reasons) went to <a href=\"/level-484\">Level 484</a>, nearly got snow blindness, and had to rush to an exit. After about half an hour of constant searching, he found an camouflaged elevator door placed on\u2026 the floor, for some reason. He got in, and the <em>entire</em> thing was upside-down. Poor guy. Anyways, after pressing on the button \"162\", Ben stated that the elevator music felt very off. Every instrument used in it sounded like they were being played by a five-year old. While that was happening, he also heard a loud <em>thud</em>, then the entire elevator started falling at light speed. Luckily, Ben has watched a few YouTube videos about these kinds of situations at <a href=\"/the-frontrooms\">Earth</a>, so he was good. Well, until the door opened and he found himself in <a href=\"/level-8\">Level 8</a>. He hasn't escaped the level yet, but he's still in contact with me, so that's nice.</p><br><p>Lastly, for the person that's in a hospital right now, it's one of my older friends (I'll codename her \"Jennifer\") who's deaf. Yeah\u2026 I have no idea how she's alive right now. It's good that she is, though. So what happened with her is that she had just entered <a href=\"/level-76\">Level 76</a> and was hiding for a while until she got the courage to move around a bit. After moving more, she hid yet again. Kinda feel bad for her that she has to do this kind of stuff to survive. So yeah, after a ton of repeating that, she accidentally pressed the call button for an elevator, and as such, decided to enter it. To her surprise, however, she discovered that the insides of the thing were <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">completely</span> invisible. And before she could exit it, she fell in this big hole in the ground and got injured really badly. But in a giant stroke of luck, she landed in <a href=\"/level-11\">11</a> and got hospitalized. She's still in a coma, but the doctors have assured that she should be returning in about a month.</p><br><p>TL;DR: Elevators aren't utterly overpowered; sometimes, they malfunction and do weird shit.</p><br><p>I've attached some proof for all of these claims, but can you please keep them private? Neither me nor my friends want randoms knowing our names and all that stuff. Most people I meet are really creepy.</p><br><p>Take care,<br/>\nMason</p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:130%;\"><span style=\"color: #dd0000\"><strong>Trevor Mendoza</strong></span></span> <span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><span style=\"font-size:95%;\"><span style=\"color: #6e727a\">Mar 1\u00a02023\u00a010:02 AM</span></span><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #cacbcd\">Hello</span> <span class=\"ping\"><span style=\"color: #dee0fc\">@Secondary Ping</span></span><span style=\"color: #cacbcd\">!</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color:#cacbcd\">So, many of you probably know about the whole \"elevator overpowered\" joke that's been floating around for a while, right?</span></p><br><p><span style=\"color:#cacbcd\">Well, I hate to break it to everyone, but they aren't actually all candies and rainbows.</span></p><br><p><span style=\"color:#cacbcd\">Recently, someone gave a witness account of them and their friends encountering certain elevators that are\u2026 wacky, to say the least.</span></p><br><p><span style=\"color:#cacbcd\">But why are we announcing this if it's only happened to three people?</span></p><br><p><span style=\"color:#cacbcd\">Here\u2019s the thing: they are not the only ones.

    "description": "<p><strong>Koko</strong> is a highly sapient AI constructed by Backrooms Robotics with the sole purpose of attempting to breach into sensitive files of <a href=\"/the-m-e-g\">The M.E.G.</a> Database. The AI in question was not built to be an AI, however, due to circumstances only known to Backrooms Robotics, <strong>Koko</strong> became a sapient Entity who appears to hold morals. <strong>Koko</strong> can be seen on many separate computer terminals, displaying herself as an asian female with light blue hair, oftentimes with a deep blue streak, excluding times when she is undergoing \"PRS_3_AGY\". <strong>Koko</strong> is highly intelligent, and has three self-constructed built in personalities, which she switches to when she sees fit.</p><br><p><strong>Koko's</strong> behavior is largely unpredictable due to her nature due to her personalities programmed in. It is largely suspected that she self-programmed in her second and third personalities in accordance to how others behaved. <strong>Koko</strong> is unique because she is only capable of switching her device once every 24 hours, due to unknown reasonings. After 24 hours, she transfers to a separate device of her choice, typically close to the device she was in. If she is forced outside of her main device, she will instead be transferred to a random device, which can be virtually anywhere within The Backrooms. Her programmed personalities are as follows.</p><br><p><strong>Koko</strong> <em>does</em> appear to be somewhat capable of controlling these programmed emotions, and typically chooses to engage in \"PRS_1_HPY\". She also appears to be capable of programming more emotions, but chooses to not create more<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup>. <strong>Koko's</strong> current behavior state is as follow: Standyby at PRS_1_HPY, if angered then PRS_3_AGY, if harmed then PRS_2_ENL. <strong>Koko</strong> is currently under the M.E.G. Database, cleaning up files which have been misplaced. For this reason, <strong>Koko</strong> should <em>never</em> be angered.</p><br><p><strong>Koko</strong> is composed of a self-building code which is currently unable to be understood. It seems to have made adaptations from The Backrooms itself, and it appears to have been made with the intentions of being \"manifested\" by The Backrooms. Attempts to replicate these results have shown no results close to the AI. <strong>Koko</strong> has an established \"heart\", which appears to be a line of code developed by herself. This code appears to be incapable of being accessed, no matter what attempts are made. <strong>Koko's</strong> \"heart\" appears to be what drives her to change emotions, and she seems to have vowed to protect it at all cost. For this reason, the only other way to destroy <strong>Koko</strong> would be to destroy all electronic devices within The Backrooms, which may be impossible. For this reason, <strong>Koko</strong> must be protected by The M.E.G.</p><br><p>The following interview was done with Researcher Ly's cell phone, and was conducted by Researcher Ormara.</p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p><br><p style=\"text-align: center;\">2:36PM</p><br><p><span class=\"blue\">Hello there, Entity 82</span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span class=\"green\"><em>Hello there, Researcher Ly.</em></span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span class=\"blue\">I'm afraid I am not Researcher Ly.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span class=\"green\"><em>Are you malware?

    "title": "- \"The Hermit\"",
    "description": "<p>The Hermit is a nomadic humanoid creature of unknown origin. It lives in a shack, about the size of a trailer, that it carries on its back. The shack is made of a material foreign to any well-known level, but it has properties similar to tin sheets, rotted wood, and dried bone. When deployed, the front \"lawn\" of the shack is adorned with bloodied sharpened sticks with skewered corpses of various entities found within the Backrooms. Some of these corpses include:</p><br><p>The shack itself has two rooms: a dining room and a kitchen. The dining room consists of a large rectangular wooden table with a total of 6 chairs surrounding it (two chairs per length, one chair per width.) All of these chairs are refurbished metal folding chairs, except for the chair on the left end, which is instead a large wooden throne, velvet cushions adorning the seat and back. The Hermit usually sits in this throne for his meals (unless it has a guest of honor, in which case it moves one chair to the right, allowing the guest to sit in the throne.) On the walls of the dining room are yet more trophies of other Entities, including:</p><br><p>The kitchen, on the other hand, is a crude abomination of spare parts welded together in order to create something that can hypothetically be used to cook. The ramshackle cupboards are full of different plates and bowls made out of the same tin-like substance as the rest of the house. The cooling unit holds 2 gallons of <a href=\"/object-1\">Almond Water</a>, 2 bushels of an unspecified herb, and at least 4 pounds of miscellaneous meats at all times.</p><br><p>The Hermit is uncharacteristically hospitable, often offering guests respite, complete with meals composed of cooked meat (later identified to be the flesh of various entities) and tea (a currently unknown plant brewed in almond water.) It talks with a masculine, slightly Irish accent. It has an affinity for long, thoughtful conversations, especially on the topic of food. If allowed, The Hermit will prattle on for hours about his favorite dishes to cook and serve to those that it trusts.</p><br><p>Every once in a while, The Hermit can be found without its shack, roaming the various halls of the Backrooms. Surveillance officers affiliated with <a href=\"/the-m-e-g\">M.E.G.</a> have reported sightings of a creature matching The Hermit\u2019s visual description in Levels <a href=\"/level-1\">1</a>, <a href=\"/level-3\">3</a>, <a href=\"/level-5\">5</a>, and <a href=\"/level-7\">7</a>. Sightings of The Hermit have yet to be documented at any level beyond <a href=\"/level-8\">8</a>, but it is wise to assume that The Hermit has traveled there before due to its various trophies.</p><br><p>Eye witness reports of The Hermit while roaming have described it as a \u201ccunning hunter.\u201d Various witness accounts say that, while hunting, The Hermit uses a crossbow, a bone saw, and bear traps, and will hunt humans as well as other Entities.</p><br><p>The testimony of an armed M.E.G. officer describes The Hermit's hunting tactics in detail. The Hermit stealthily tracks its prey, then strikes in quick bursts, either firing a crossbow bolt or dashing in at insane speeds to slash with its saw. After making an attack, it retreats back into the shadows before anybody can feasibly react. The Hermit never seems to run out of ammo on its crossbow, and the bone saw is always sharpened.</p><br><p>The Hermit has a humanoid appearance, although it is significantly taller than the average human male. It wears a long, brown, patchy cloak that trails across the ground and a dirty white mask in the shape of a large avian skull. It is currently unknown whether these two adornments are part of The Hermit\u2019s body or simply just clothing.</p><br><p>The Hermit, despite its human appearance and personality, is anything but. Surviving witnesses of The Hermit's hunt state that it \"grows another pair of thin, black legs\" in order to chase down its prey. One particular witness recalls The Hermit ejecting acid from its eye socket, implying that it may be an arthropod behind its mask. However, many of these claims came from people suffering from symptoms of delirium and insanity, so the validity of these claims should be called into question.</p><br><p>As deduced by the Strangler head on a stake outside of The Hermit's abode, it is theorized that The Hermit has the ability to leave inescapable Levels. More research must be done in order to either confirm or deny this notion.</p><br><p>The Hermit was first discovered by M.E.G. officer Codename \"Moxie\" on a solo expedition of Floor 5 on an expedition to retrieve sustainable resources. As Moxie approached the deployed shack, they were greeted by The Hermit, who beckoned them inside, offering a meal. Below is the conversation had over dinner by Moxie and The Hermit, recorded by Moxie's personal video recorder concealed in their jacket.</p><br><p><strong>Begin Log: 19:22</strong><br/>\n<strong>Interviewer:</strong> M.E.G. Officer Codename: Moxie<br/>\n<strong>Interviewee:</strong> The Hermit</p><br><p><strong>Moxie:</strong> This is a nice place you got here. Most people back at camp would kill for a house like this.</p><br><p><strong>The Hermit:</strong> \u2026indeed it is. I will make some food.</p><br><p><em>The Hermit ushers Moxie to the seat across from the throne and walks into the kitchen</em>.</p><br><p><strong>Moxie:</strong> What are you making?</p><br><p><strong>The Hermit:</strong> (from the kitchen) That would be a personal secret. We would not want people spreading my recipes around, now would we?</p><br><p><em>Silence for 24 seconds. Moxie looks at the trophies on the wall.</em></p><br><p><strong>Moxie:</strong> Are those the wings of a deathmoth? A female, to be precise?</p><br><p><strong>The Hermit:</strong> (from the kitchen) Oh, so that is what those are called. I suppose so.</p><br><p><strong>Moxie:</strong> How did you get them?</p><br><p><strong>The Hermit:</strong> (from the kitchen) I hunt. Mainly for ingredients. Also for sport.</p><br><p><em>Moxie notices the badge of Officer Bojack on the wall. Silence for 12 seconds. The Hermit walks back into the room holding two identical plates of what appears to be hot tea and steak.</em></p><br><p><strong>The Hermit:</strong> Your meal is ready.</p><br><p><strong>Moxie:</strong> That was abnormally quick.</p><br><p><strong>The Hermit:</strong> I have my methods. Enjoy.</p><br><p><em>Moxie picks up a fork and knife and cuts into the steak. They wait for The Hermit to take a bite first, then follow suit.</em></p><br><p><strong>Moxie:</strong> This isn't bad. What kind of meat is it?</p><br><p><strong>The Hermit:</strong> I would be delighted to sit here and brag about my culinary skills, but revealing my secrets may detract visitors.</p><br><p><strong>Moxie:</strong> Visitors?</p><br><p><strong>The Hermit:</strong> I enjoy welcoming visitors into my home. It is a symbol of hospitality and friendship, is it not? Besides, you have been my best guest so far. All of the others have had\u2026 below-average conduct.</p><br><p><em>Moxie glances at the badge again, then takes a sip of tea.</em></p><br><p><strong>Moxie:</strong> Wow. This is exceptional. I've never even tasted tea like this before. Seriously, what's your deal?</p><br><p><strong>The Hermit:</strong> I am truly flattered, but I have made it clear that my secrets shall remain just that: secrets.</p><br><p><strong>Moxie:</strong> \u2026do you at least have any tips about how to prepare food?</p><br><p><em>The Hermit pauses.</em></p><br><p><strong>The Hermit:</strong> \u2026of course. The key is to go with what you feel is right, not what any recipe calls for. At the end of the day, it is your meal, so you have to make it your own. Otherwise, you cannot call yourself a true chef.</p><br><p><strong>Moxie:</strong> I see.</p><br><p><strong>The Hermit:</strong> Oh, and do not forget: choice of ingredients is vital. No amount of natural talent in the kitchen will save a meal with poorly selected components. Experiment with new ideas and build your style of cooking from there.</p><br><p><em>Moxie glances at The Hermit's plate. It's completely empty, save for the cup that once held the tea.</em></p><br><p><strong>Moxie:</strong> Well, I should be off. I've had my share.</p><br><p><strong>The Hermit:</strong> Are you positive? I had plans for dessert.</p><br><p><strong>Moxie:</strong> Trust me. I'd love to stay and chat, but I have people back at my settlement that are probably wondering where I am. It's been much longer than I intended to stay out.</p><br><p><strong>The Hermit:</strong> What a shame. Come back soon, and tell your friends to stop by.</p><br><p><strong>Moxie:</strong> I'll be sure to.</p><br><p><em>Moxie stands up and offers a handshake to The Hermit, who accepts without hesitation. As they walk out, Moxie slips a small sliver of meat into their pocket for inspection.</em></p><br><p><strong>End Log: 19:27</strong></p><br><p>Upon Moxie's return to Base Alpha, the meat served to them was deduced to be that of a Skin-Stealer. Moxie suffered from minor stomach aches and diarrhea for the next 48 hours. However, Moxie did not feel hungry for the next 7 days after their encounter with The Hermit. Any attempts for M.E.G. to replicate the dish were unsuccessful. Moxie now regularly visits The Hermit for meals and conversation.</p><br><p>While visiting The Hermit for dinner\u2026</p><br><p>While being hunted by The Hermit\u2026</p><br><p>While visiting The Hermit for dinner, don't\u2026</p><br><p>While being hunted by The Hermit, don't\u2026</p><br><p>It has been roughly a month and a half since Moxie started routinely visiting The Hermit. As of late, Moxie has refused to record their conversations with The Hermit. Other M.E.G. officers and wanderers have noticed Moxie's skin get paler and gaunter as they visit The Hermit more and more often. It has been 17 days since Moxie has last been seen eating anywhere other than at The Hermit's shack. Medical monitors have revealed Moxie's heart rate to be roughly 30% lower than the average human's at rest. However, Moxie's personality is unchanged. Private \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 has made the executive decision to stealthily place an audio recording device on the inside of Moxie's jacket. The following conversation was recorded during Moxie's 13th visit to The Hermit.</p><br><p><strong>Begin Log: 18:59</strong><br/>\n<strong>Interviewer:</strong> M.E.G. Officer Codename: Moxie<br/>\n<strong>Interviewee:</strong> The Hermit</p><br><p><strong>The Hermit:</strong> Well, if it isn't \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588! Let me guess; back for a bit more food?</p><br><p><strong>Moxie:</strong> You know it. I just can't live without it.</p><br><p><strong>The Hermit:</strong> I'm flattered. Coming right up.</p><br><p><em>Footsteps. Silence for 12 seconds.</em></p><br><p><strong>Moxie:</strong> Say, that's a new trophy. How'd you manage that?</p><br><p><strong>The Hermit (far):</strong> Oh, that? That one was simple. A clean strike at the legs, and it can barely move anymore. After that, it is easy pickings.</p><br><p><strong>Moxie:</strong> Neat. You know, I'm not too shabby with a rifle myself.</p><br><p><strong>The Hermit (far):</strong> Oh?</p><br><p><strong>Moxie:</strong> You better believe it. Before I got dragged into this hellhole, I used to hunt all kinds of vermin. I had this old cabin back in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. One of the coziest places I can remember. Reminds me a lot of this place, now that I mention it.</p><br><p><strong>The Hermit (far):</strong> That sounds like a nice place. I'm sure you are skilled at shooting common rodents, but do you think you can handle the beasts that roam these halls?</p><br><p><strong>Moxie:</strong> I wouldn't be here if I couldn't.</p><br><p><em>Footsteps. Plates rattling. The creaking of a chair.</em></p><br><p><strong>The Hermit:</strong> I like your style. You know, if you would ever want to join me on one of my hunts, I would be happy to have you.</p><br><p><strong>Moxie:</strong> You really think I can keep up with you? You've taken on Deathmoths by yourself!</p><br><p><strong>The Hermit:</strong> Trust me. As long as you stick with me, you will be fine. You can cover my back, and I will cover yours.</p><br><p><strong>Moxie:</strong> I guess that's true. What do I even have to worry about?</p><br><p><strong>The Hermit:</strong> Precisely. <em>*sips*</em></p><br><p><em>Silence for 9 seconds.</em></p><br><p><strong>Moxie:</strong> I've been meaning to ask you something.</p><br><p><strong>The Hermit:</strong> And what might that be?</p><br><p><strong>Moxie:</strong> \u2026who are you? Like, before all of this madness happened, all of us were completely different. I ran a country club, for god's sake. But now, I'm trapped in this infinite goddamn prison. I used to <em>be</em> somebody. But, now, I'm just a loner biding his time until he inevitably dies. So, before you got trapped here like the rest of us, who were you?</p><br><p><em>Silence for 6 seconds.</em></p><br><p><strong>The Hermit:</strong> \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, sometimes, you have to forget your past. It drags you down. If you dwell on it for too long, it will tear you to pieces while you are too busy looking for the answers to pointless questions. As long as the past lingers in the back of your head, you cannot fully focus on the present. That is one of the reasons why I am such a proficient hunter; I refuse to let my past cloud my thoughts and interrupt my hunt.</p><br><p><strong>Moxie:</strong> \u2026I guess you're right. As always. Thanks for the advice.</p><br><p><strong>The Hermit:</strong> It is my pleasure. Would you like to stay for dessert?</p><br><p><strong>Moxie:</strong> I'd love to, but I probably shouldn't. Those wusses back at H.Q. are probably wondering where I've been.</p><br><p><strong>The Hermit:</strong> That makes sense. Take care. Please consider my hunting offer. It would be a joy to have you.</p><br><p><strong>Moxie:</strong> I'd love to go out on a hunt with you! Just pick the time and place by next visit. See you!</p><br><p><strong>End Log: 19:09</strong></p><br><p>The feed was interrupted 3 minutes after the conversation ended. Upon Moxie's return, they refused to speak with Private \u2588\u2588\u2588, nor any other officer. Moxie entered their quarters and did not leave for 46 hours. Upon their eventual exit, they seemed much happier than normal.</p><br><p>~ <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-luxobar\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6346589); return false;\"><img alt=\"Dr Luxobar\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=6346589&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334291\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=6346589)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-luxobar\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6346589); return false;\">Dr Luxobar</a></span><br/>\nArt also by <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-luxobar\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6346589); return false;\"><img alt=\"Dr Luxobar\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=6346589&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334291\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=6346589)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-luxobar\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6346589); return false;\">Dr Luxobar</a></span></p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/entity-82\">Entity 82</a> | Entity 83 | <a href=\"/entity-84\">Entity 84</a> \u00bb</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/entity-83\">Entity 83 - \"The Hermit\"</a>\" by Dr Luxobar, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

    "description": "<p><strong>Entity 84</strong> is a singular large hairy dog that roams the many Levels inside the Backrooms, seemingly with the same movement constraints of the many humans in the Backrooms as well. It is unknown whether <strong>Entity 84</strong> is from the Frontrooms and simply no-clipped into the Backrooms, or if his origins are from inside. Though his anomalous fur seems to point toward the latter. When petting <strong>Entity 84</strong> one can fall into the neverending fur that covers him, and end up on <a href=\"/level-241\">Level 241</a>.</p><br><p>A red collar can be found under the fur around the neck of the entity, somehow not also falling into <a href=\"/level-241\">Level 241</a> like other objects or creatures do. Attached is a metal bone-shaped label with the name \"King Rasputin Bartholemew III\" in small engraved text on one side. On the other side the instructions, \"If lost return to the seventh dialect of the march of Atrodium, the killer of Jungham.\" It is unknown what these instructions mean or who either of the described characters are. Investigation pending.</p><br><p><strong>Entity 84</strong> acts like an average dog, despite his habitat. He will spend all of his time exploring the Backrooms, or following someone if he so chooses. Restraining him is ill-advised, as it does not only distress the Entity but does not work due to the anomalous property of his fur. The Entity seems to recognize dangerous situations or objects such as firearms or knives. Anyone seen attempting to harm the Entity is to be punished as seen fit.</p><br><p>Other Entities do not appear to attack the Entity, rather ignoring him, or acting rather curious or friendly towards him. The Entity reciprocates said actions, however, it was discovered in M.E.G.: Log 3432 that given the chance, <strong>Entity 84</strong> will bark or even attack to protect a human he has a strong connection with. It was also discovered in this same log that other Entities are presumed afraid to attack <strong>Entity 84</strong>, choosing to flee rather than easily dispatching him.</p><br><p><strong>Entity 84</strong> is a male four (4) year old canine, of the breed known as the Chow Chow. He seems to be in good health and the fur that covers him is in a constant brushed state, even without being in contact with a person for a long period of time. Cutting said fur has been attempted to no avail. In an attempt to relieve him a M.E.G. Operative shaved about five (5) inches of fur off of the Entity, which worked at first until it was discovered it had grown back within the next hour.</p><br><p>He does not need to consume food nor water, however, when given the opportunity will do so enthusiastically. It is recommended that you clean his face after feeding him as he gets quite messy. His favorite food to date is peanut butter.</p><br><p>Unlike a regular dog, however, when petting him, the fur on his body does not seem to connect to anything, instead of going deeper and deeper depending on where you begin. Doing this does not seem to hurt the Entity. If approx. thirty (30) cm. into the fur of the Entity, one will begin to be pulled into the fur via. unknown forces. Whether this benefits the Entity or not is unknown, though many choose to believe it does not for emotional purposes. When about half a meter into the fur, one will find themselves falling from the ceiling into <a href=\"/level-241\">Level 241</a>.</p><br><p>Discovered by a small M.E.G. task force wandering the halls of <a href=\"/level-0\">Level 0</a>, quickly followed by one of the members falling into <a href=\"/level-241\">Level 241</a> through an attempt to pet him.</p><br><p><a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/pandashark-s-author-page|\">PandaShark71004</a></p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/entity-83\">Entity 83</a> | Entity 84 | <a href=\"/entity-85\">Entity 85</a> \u00bb</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/entity-84\">Entity 84</a>\" by PandaShark71004, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

    "description": "<p>This Entity is a snake like parasite, similar to a Garter Snake. It is extremely small in size. This Entity has strong psychic powers to manipulate your mind to lie every time an important sentence is spoken, to lure the victims into traps. This occurs when the Entity spots you, then quietly slithers towards you. Then it proceeds to crawl into your ear, and you will not feel anything. The Entity will proceed to take slight control of you from there then it will turn into three (3) stages of control.</p><br><p>This Entity will start by climbing a surface towards the host, then it will crawl into your ear, go through the ear system, and makes it's way to the brain, where it proceeds to put it's mouth on it, and leaves itself in stasis for weeks. This is the 'First Stage', where the host will start to lie, and deceive people, without them knowing. This will last for a few weeks, the Entity will slowly absorb your knowledge while in this stage. The 'Second Stage' is to where the Entity will detach from your brain, and will start to travel around your body, and under your skin. Using it's abilities, it will go through every functional part of the body, and will take control of it slowly, while this stage is happening, the host will repetitively say \"Slithering\u2026 Crawling\u2026 Slithering\u2026\". The third and 'Final Stage' is where the hosts body is no longer controllable by the host itself, and the Entity will use the body to live in and control until the body is deceased, then the Entities will use the body to lay eggs, to create new <strong>Paralies</strong>.</p><br><p>This Entity looks very similar to a snake species known as 'Garter Snakes', but their size is way smaller then normal Garter Snakes. You cannot hear them, or feel them. They are extremely stealthy, and will do anything to enter it's host. The Entity will look the same throughout the First Stage. the Second Stage will have the snake become more of a blue hue, with it crossing through the hosts skin. the final stage, The Entity is extremely bumpy, and is fully blue. This color will be lost a few weeks after it leaves the host.</p><br><p>This Entity was found when a user posted an entry on our Database, which was deceptive, and was mostly fake. <a href=\"/the-m-e-g\">The M.E.G.</a> <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">sent out Team \"Snake Trappers\" to assist the situation.</span> The entry has since been archived.</p><br><p>This entry was made by one of our members from Team \"Volunteer Squad\", who assisted Team \"Wild Warriors\" with the capturing of the Entity.

    "description": "<p>Hiveminds are plantlike organisms originating in <a href=\"/level-4\">Level 4</a> that spread to <a href=\"/level-8\">Level 8</a> on 1/4/2020. They are roughly the size and shape of a pear, seeming to be a cross between a reptile and an embryophyte. They resemble spiders, but have six rootlike legs and extremely elongated \"heads\". Their primitive heads contain a brain almost equal to the body mass of the rest of the organism. They have no eyes, but rather a very light pink membrane around their entire head that appears to be photosensitive, nearly replicating one wider eye. They have no mouth, instead using small suckers on the end of their extremities to harvest water and minerals. They seem to have adapted to consume radiation from florescent lights, and in the absence of such, will have their growth stunted greatly when relying just on minerals.</p><br><p>One of the most interesting aspects of the entity is its ability to adapt and evolve within mere weeks or months. Upon being introduced to a cave in <a href=\"/level-8\">Level 8</a> by accidental transmission, a new species evolved within roughly two months, much more adapted to life without light.</p><br><p>Hiveminds, while rarely prepared, can be consumed if cooked properly and detoxified. While their first recorded cultivation for nutrition was done by <a href=\"/the-lost\">The Lost</a>, but most prominently done by <a href=\"/the-eyes-of-argos\">The Eyes of Argos</a>. The <a href=\"/b-n-t-g\">B.N.T.G.</a> have outlawed this practice as it can lead to poisoning if done incorrectly. The <a href=\"/the-m-e-g\">M.E.G.</a> now requires members to have a license to cultivate and prepare Hiveminds. As of 1/10/2021, Tom's Diner is the only place with such a license.</p><br><p>Hiveminds are generally harmless and are content to stay rooted to a single spot for their roughly 7-week lifespan. However, if put in immediate danger, will scuttle away to a recluse area. They constantly release invisibly small amounts of spores, which will sometimes grow into more Hivemind specimens.</p><br><p>The strangest trait of the Hivemind is its namesake. Hiveminds all share one collective conscious and are generally thought of as a singular entity in many bodies. Additionally, while this entity is not particularly intelligent, it has enough brainpower to understand simple human attempts at communications, similar to the way a dog or pig would.</p><br><p>The spores released by Hiveminds can be irritating to the esophagus if the person inhaling the spores has asthma or a similar condition. Additionally, large quantities of the spores can cause slight memory alteration, but Hiveminds as a whole are largely harmless.</p><br><p>It is unknown who discovered Hiveminds, or when their discovery took place. The first recorded cultivation of Hiveminds for food purposes was done by <a href=\"/the-lost\">The Lost</a>.</p><br><p>As of 2/12/21, two separate species of Hivemind exist. The Wall Hivemind was the original, with six leglike appendages, a slight purple-pink hue, and around the size and shape of a small pear. A secondary species, the Cave Hivemind, now exists in <a href=\"/level-8\">level 8</a>. These Hiveminds are almost entirely white, glow much more violently, and are significantly smaller than Wall Hiveminds. It is unknown whether the species still share a single mind or if they are now two separate beings.</p><br><p>Any reports of a massive, carnivorous Hivemind on Level 4 are entirely false. No Hivemind could ever grow to such sizes in such low-light conditions. Additionally, no Hivemind has ever been observed to consume meat. If you're still not convinced, aberrant Hiveminds are impossible. They share one collective mind. If one was disconnected from it, the Hivemind would have no mind. It would just die.</p><br><p>All things considered, any reports of this Hivemind are false and should be taken worth a grain of salt.</p><br><p>-Abraham Lena</p><br><p><span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/cementsandwich\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6931847); return false;\"><img alt=\"CementSandwich\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=6931847&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334083\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=6931847)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/cementsandwich\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6931847); return false;\">CementSandwich</a></span></p><br><p>Sandboxes: <a href=\"http://backrooms-sandbox-2.wikidot.com/cementsandwich\">http://backrooms-sandbox-2.wikidot.com/cementsandwich</a>, <a href=\"http://backrooms-sandbox-2.wikidot.com/cementsandwich-2\">http://backrooms-sandbox-2.wikidot.com/cementsandwich-2</a></p><br><p>Contact thru Discord - CementSandwich#6601</p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/entity-87\">Entity 87</a> | Entity 88 | <a href=\"/entity-89\">Entity 89</a> \u00bb</p><br>",

    "description": "<p><strong>Ants</strong> are a collective of small, fuzzy, round creatures who only seem to enjoy huddling around the darkest corners of rooms. With the earliest M.E.G. reports of <strong>Ants</strong> having been from <a href=\"/level-1\">Level 1</a>, there have since been reports in <a href=\"/level-102\">Level 102</a>, <a href=\"/level-196\">Level 196</a> as well as in <a href=\"/level-401\">Level 401</a>. They seem to have no clear migration pattern, moving from level to level whenever they feel like it.</p><br><p>While they can harm humans to some extent, ultimately, they don't really pose a threat to us.</p><br><p>A colony of <strong>Ants</strong>, when undisturbed, are usually spotted huddled around together in corners. <strong>Ant</strong> colonies can vary in size, from having dozens to hundreds of ants all in one location.</p><br><p><strong>Ants</strong> will usually stay in their own lane and not approach any passerbys unless someone gets close enough, or they are outright provoked. If near three feet of them, they will quickly start to climb up towards the person and crawl around them. They then start sticking onto the person, 'biting' similarly to how a leech would. Though, this can easily be avoided by just picking them off your skin. The worst these bites can cause is mild bruising.</p><br><p><strong>Ants</strong> are fuzzy entities that can vary from 2-6 centimeters wide. They seem to absorb light, which gives them their recognizable pitch black appearance. This also gives off the illusion of them being much bigger than they appear when huddled together in colonies, which doubles as a defense mechanism to deter bigger entities from wanting to draw near.</p><br><p>Ants have been a commonly reported on entity since the M.E.G. had been formed, and had most likely been discovered by smaller groups prior. The M.E.G.'s first photographic evidence of ants however, had only been taken a few years ago or so by an anonymous photographer, later identified to be M.E.G. photographer <em>Nicole Matthews.</em></p><br><p>written by <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/rats-scraps\">ratscrapz</a> :-)</p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/entity-88\">Entity 88</a> | Entity 89 | <a href=\"/entity-90\">Entity 90</a> \u00bb</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/entity-89\">Entity 89 - \"Ants\"</a>\" by ratscrapz, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

    "description": "<p>The Steel are sentient machine-like creatures made from various hard metals. The species is notable for its telepathic and telekinetic abilities; the latter of which allows them to use their minds to levitate themselves and smaller objects. Steel scholars and other researchers have investigated the mechanism driving these powers - however, this research has not reached a definitive conclusion.</p><br><p>There is significant variation between individual Steels. The species has no natural reproductive process - Steel tribes instead gather up various resources and combine them through their telepathic powers to create a new Steel, in a process they call \u201cThe Startup\u201d. The Steel do not age, but can be killed if subjected to enough damage.</p><br><p>Individual Steels vary in height, ranging from four to eight feet, correlating with the number of different metals in each individual. Steels often change their appearance by adding or removing metal and by painting themselves different colors.</p><br><p>The Steel do not communicate verbally - instead they use telepathy, or hand gestures and informal sign languages.</p><br><p>Steel historians believe that the founding members of their communities within Level -15 eventually perished due to various environmental hazards. This, along with a failure to preserve their history via written methods, resulted in it becoming lost to time.</p><br><p>A large part of The Steel's modern culture is dedicated towards recovering this history and gathering more information surrounding their origins. Even now, they have no knowledge of how their species entered The Backrooms, or where they came from beforehand.</p><br><p>The few written records that do exist indicate that, at one point, they met members of <a href=\"/the-lost\">The Lost</a> and befriended them quickly. As development within their Level -15 settlements eventually came to a stand-still, members of their species were then sent out into the wider Backrooms in order to continue trade with The Lost and to learn more about other species. It is thought that this eventually resulted in their wide-spread population.</p><br><p>Current theories about where The Steel come from vary. Some Steel tribes believe they came from Mars, others believe they are the long-forgotten cousins of the extinct <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-189\">Macchina</a> species.</p><br><p>The Steel are well-respected scholars, and often work with The M.E.G. and other groups. In general, they work towards the mutual goal of learning more about their own species, though individual Steels have contributed to a wide range of research.</p><br><p>Other members of The Steel are notable for their contributions to the arts within The Backrooms. The construction of certain human settlements often rely on Steel aid, as their levitative abilities are extremely useful for lifting and carrying heavy resources.</p><br><p>Music performed by The Steel is considered its own sub-genre. They can operate multiple instruments at once when using their telepathy, effectively turning a proficient Steel musician into a one-man-band.</p><br><p>A mural created by The Church of The Revered depicting their creation.</p><br><p>The Church of The Revered is a controversial Steel religious sect, with a small number of adherents. The faith posits they were created by an unknown, possibly human group, eons before any evidence of their existence.</p><br><p>Reputable Steel scholars disdain The Revered, and emphasize that the religion conflicts with The Steel's historical accounts of meeting The Lost, as well as a lack of any human records regarding The Steel\u2019s creation.</p><br><p>In general, The Steel are friendly and intelligent. Their upbringing and culture encourages familiarity with The Backrooms and cooperation with other species, and tends to emphasize qualities like analytical thinking and logic-driven action.</p><br><p>The M.E.G. is committed to assisting The Steel in rediscovering their history, and research remains ongoing.</p><br><p><em>Machine men, with machine minds and machine hearts!</em></p><br><p>Written by <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-bierre\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6155146); return false;\"><img alt=\"Dr Bierre\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=6155146&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334084\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=6155146)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-bierre\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6155146); return false;\">Dr Bierre</a></span></p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/entity-89\">Entity 89</a> | Entity 90 | <a href=\"/entity-91\">Entity 91</a> \u00bb</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/entity-90\">Entity 90 - \"The Steel\"</a>\" by Dr Bierre, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

    "description": "<p><strong>Entity 92</strong>, also known as \"Ferren\" is often described as a cute, small, highly trained siamese ferret owned by the B.N.T.G. that has the ability to no-clip to any level he wishes to. Ferren is rumored to have the ability to no-clip to specific areas in levels themselves if he so desires.</p><br><p>Notably, wanderers who have physical contact with Ferren when he no-clips will also no-clip into the same level and area as Ferren. His primary residence is a small ferret cage found in Level 1's traders' keep, though the B.N.T.G. maintains similar cages in all of their trading outposts.</p><br><p>Ferren is noted as being extremely loyal due to his years of training. Personality traits are often characterized by his playful and hyperactive attitude. <strong>Entity 92</strong> can be found roaming outposts; wanderers are permitted to interact and play with Ferren while he roams.</p><br><p>While Ferren's purpose to the B.N.T.G. is not fully understood, it has been stated by the B.N.T.G. that he acts as a way to obtain resources that may otherwise be unreachable or too risky to secure by conventional methods.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> This has led to the supposition that <strong>Entity 92</strong>'s abilities allow him to enter otherwise perilous levels to harvest resources for the B.N.T.G. with ease.</p><br><p>The B.N.T.G. have built a morning and nighttime routine for Ferren to best energize him, which can be found below.</p><br><p><strong>Entity 92</strong>'s discovery date has not yet been disclosed by the B.N.T.G. Operative Samuel L. from the B.N.T.G. was interviewed on 01/01/25 by operative Dr. Ashley K. of <a href=\"/the-m-e-g\">the M.E.G.</a> to get a better understanding of what possibly happened on the first encounter.</p><br><p>[Ashley]: Since we're both aware of why you're being called in today, let's just jump right into it! Now, this is going to sound blunt but\u2026 do you know anything of Ferren? His background?<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n[Samuel]: Heh, not a small talker I see. Well, I know quite a bit, albeit I'm not his caretaker by any means- but I know everything from his schedule to his abilities and even some commands.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n[Ashley]: So then you must be aware of any first encounters with the entity?<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n[Samuel]: Uhm, gonna be honest with ya, I really only know a tiny bit about that. Although, I'm curious why we're even having this chat. Aren't you people supposed to be like, finding a way out of here? Not studying some\u2026 animal, so why so curious?<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n[Ashley]: It's quite telling if this entity has the ability to no-clip anywhere in this place. Finding out its abilities has the potential of getting those who want out of here, out of here.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n[Samuel]: Interesting, anyway\u2026 I know that it was one of the higher-ups that actually first came across Ferren. At first, he was just a pet to him; though, none of us really believed Ferren was an actual ferret. I mean like- there are <a href=\"/entity-26\">talking cats</a> and <a href=\"/entity-7\">parrots</a> that make people worship it. Anyway, the first encounter I've ever had with it was when it was bringing us resources from <a href=\"/level-8\">Level 8</a>.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n[Ashley]: So then why so secretive? Why hide a first encounter if it was something as mundane as that?<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n[Samuel]: To be honest, I don't really know. Although, most of us think that our boss saw the creature do something special. Maybe it has another ability that's not just traveling? I don't really know in all honesty. Is there anything else you'd like to know?<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n[Ashley]: Well, is there anything else you can share?<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n[Samuel]: Well, there is one more thing I guess I should share; Ferren recently has been a little\u2026 mischievous. I'd just recommend being a little cautious if you're interacting with him. Alright, can I leave now? If this goes on for too long some of my higher-ups might suspect me of stealing or something.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n[Ashley]: Yes, we can end our session. Thank you, Samuel, for this information, you've helped us get one more step closer to escape.</p><br><p>Welcome, B.N.T.G. caretaker!<br/>\nBy this point, I'm sure you're aware of what your task is, yes?<br/>\nNo? Well then, we should probably get you two acquainted.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nFerren is our pet, and while he is cute, cuddly, and playful; he is also one of our most important members. Ferren's job is to get into the tight spaces, or the dangerous places that our other members might not be able to access.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nHe's also useful for transportation- as you can tell, he's quite important to us, and it's your job to train him every day for these types of situations.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nTo start, you're to choose a basic command from this list:</p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nOnce any one of these basic tasks has been completed, you should take a slight break. Ferren, while a member, is still an animal. It's important we take care of him like all animals; after all, he is very important to us.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nAlright, break over, now you can move on to a slightly more complex task. Once a day, Ferren must go into one of the following levels to gather materials. These materials don't have to be particularly useful. However, it is important that Ferren continues to demonstrate his no-clipping ability on a regular basis.</p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nThis task has likely taken a little more effort for Ferren. So let him have one last break before the final part of his training.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nAlrighty! final break is over, now you're going to do one last exercise. Ferren will do some stretches, this should prepare him for tight spaces easier. Despite his abilities, training him to not rely solely on his no-clipping is beneficial for both him and the company.</p><br><p>Now that you have completed the daily training, you can call it for now; remember, this should be done at most twice daily. No more than that, after all, we wouldn't want to tire him out too much. He deserves a nice break for now.</p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nThank you for reading this training guide.</p><br><p>There is one more thing we should discuss, while this does not apply to his training routine; it is very important all caretakers are aware that Ferren needs to be tucked in at night. This includes putting him in his cage, tucking him into his bed, and reading him a story to fall asleep to.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nFor professionalism's sake, we do not disclose this information to outside sources.</p><br><p>Written by <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/red-eyes-dragoon\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7184922); return false;\"><img alt=\"Red-eyes Dragoon\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7184922&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334083\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7184922)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/red-eyes-dragoon\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7184922); return false;\">Red-eyes Dragoon</a></span><br/>\n<a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ferret_2008.png\" target=\"_blank\">Ferret</a> under <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY-SA 4.0</a><br/>\nSpectacular GL's that have critted this: <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/captaiin\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7044984); return false;\"><img alt=\"captaiin\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7044984&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334083\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7044984)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/captaiin\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7044984); return false;\">captaiin</a></span><br/>\nAmazing GLT's who've critted this:<br/>\nOther Amazing critters who've critted this: <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/wepeter\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(8042152); return false;\"><img alt=\"WEPeter\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=8042152&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334083\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=8042152)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/wepeter\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(8042152); return false;\">WEPeter</a></span>, <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pedder\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6942049); return false;\"><img alt=\"Pedder\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=6942049&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334083\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=6942049)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pedder\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6942049); return false;\">Pedder</a></span>, <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/anime-roar\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(8294543); return false;\"><img alt=\"Anime_Roar\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=8294543&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334083\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=8294543)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/anime-roar\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(8294543); return false;\">Anime_Roar</a></span>, <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/derrick770\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(8372583); return false;\"><img alt=\"Derrick770\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=8372583&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334083\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=8372583)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/derrick770\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(8372583); return false;\">Derrick770</a></span>, <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/rosemonsignor\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(8094921); return false;\"><img alt=\"RoseMonsignor\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=8094921&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334083\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=8094921)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/rosemonsignor\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(8094921); return false;\">RoseMonsignor</a></span></p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/entity-91\">Entity 91</a> | Entity 92 | <a href=\"/entity-93\">Entity 93</a> \u00bb</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/entity-92\">Entity 92</a>\" by Red-eyes Dragoon, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

Witnesses have also reported that the entity tends to appear and disappear at random, making it difficult to catalog.

The Night Stalker has reportedly been heard making sounds similar to humming, the significance of which is as of yet not known. It isn't clear what its role in the level is, but some have speculated that it has something to do with the \"anti-shoplifting\" measures that are advertised in a few signs around Level 480.</p><br><p>Why are we here again?</p><br><p><em>To get some Cr\u00e8me Betweens.</em></p><br><p>I don't understand why we had to come all the way out here for some off-brand Oreos.</p><br><p><em>Theo, Cr\u00e8me Betweens are the good shit.

Nobody has been able to identify what brand of typewriter it is, though, as its abnormal weight makes it impossible to stop one for closer inspection.</p><br><p><strong>Clickers</strong> wander aimlessly from room to room at a pace roughly equal to a typical adult's walking speed. Nothing that gets in their way can stop them. They ignore everything around them, and other entities do not seem to see it as a threat. Hostile entities have been observed searching the vicinity of <strong>Clickers</strong> for prey and letting it continue on its way without interruption.<br/>\nThere seems to be a pattern to how <strong>Clickers</strong> move, but there is no apparent motive behind them, and attempting to catalog one's movements cause it to speed up, as if it were running away from you. <strong>Clickers</strong> make a typewriter-esque sound when moving, but do not seem to type anything on the paper they carry.</p><br><p>The <strong>Clicker</strong> is a normal-sized typewriter with small wheels on the bottom. It seems to be extremely dense, (more so than a typical Frontrooms' typewriter,) and is too heavy to pick up. The keys on a <strong>clicker</strong> are in a normal QWERTY arrangement, but if you attempt to type with one, the letters will come out as a sort of pictographic language akin to ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs. Reading these may cause temporary dizziness and disorientation.

    "description": "<p><span class=\"Blanche\">Reality Bugs take the appearance of small, iridescent, animals, bearing plenty of resemblance to the Hercules beetle (Dynastes hercules), a species of rhinoceros beetle native to the rainforests of Central America, South America, and the Lesser Antilles. The largest measured specimens were seven (7) centimeters long, not accounting for their horns.</span></p><br><p><span class=\"Blanche\">These adorable little fellows can be found in a myriad of levels. While the full list of levels they inhabit is still unknown, they seem to be quite the common sight around the Backrooms.</span></p><br><p><span class=\"Blanche\">As mentioned before, Reality Bugs bear resemblance to the Hercules beetle. As such, they also feature six legs, wings, elytra, and, on the males, a sizable horn, in some cases reaching four (4) centimeters. Sexual dimorphism is also quite prevalent, with female Bugs being noticeably smaller, not to mention their lack of horn and different elytra coloration. However, unlike their Frontrooms counterpart, that seems to feed mostly on fruit, Reality Bugs have shown a rather unique diet. They feed on the fabric of reality itself. More research is necessary to understand the means by which Reality Bugs digest their food. It is also unknown how or why Reality Bugs move through Levels in search of food.</span></p><br><p><span class=\"Blanche\">They are usually harmless, even in swarms, and never display hostile behaviour towards wanderers or entities, unless two swarms are involved in a territorial dispute, or their nests are threatened. Due to their diet, a single Reality Bug can cause minor damage to Levels, though this damage is promptly undone, as the fabric of reality repairs itself. However, a large enough swarm can cause the appearance of void areas, holes, and other distortions, eventually leading to the widespread destruction of a level, and, if nothing is done to prevent it, its erasure. Such phenomena are incredibly rare, however, since Reality Bugs tend to not eat much.</span></p><br><p><span class=\"Blanche\">A male Reality Bug that was kind enough to open his wings for the picture.</span></p><br><p><span class=\"Blanche\">An illustration of the Hercules Beetle, taken from the book \"The Naturalist's Miscellany\" by George Shaw.</span></p><br><p><span class=\"Blanche\">A female Reality Bug. Do note the lack of horn, and their gorgeous coloration.</span></p><br><p><span class=\"Blanche\">Leave them be. They are harmless, and can prove quite handy in the removal of corrupted realities.</span><br/>\n<span class=\"Blanche\">Alert the M.E.G. if you spot a large swarm (100 or more individuals) or holes in levels.</span></p><br><p><span class=\"Blanche\">Threaten their nests.

    "description": "<p>A image of a strider taken by DrawzALot (Sydney).</p><br><p><strong>Entity 96</strong>, also referred to as <strong>The Neighborhood Watch</strong>, consists of human eye-like entities predominantly found in <span class=\"customlink\"><a href=\"/level-9\">Level 9</a></span> of the Backrooms. While occasionally spotted wandering near the borders of <span class=\"customlink\"><a href=\"/level-9\">Level 9</a></span>, they never intentionally cross into other levels.</p><br><p>These entities possess keen sight and touch but lack hearing and smell. They don't require food to survive and have never been seen consuming any.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/></p><br><p><strong>The Neighborhood Watch</strong> is an exceptionally dangerous entity due to its aggressive behaviors towards any encountered living beings. The cause of this aggression remains unknown. If you happen to be spotted by <strong>The Neighborhood Watch</strong>, it's advisable to leave the level promptly.</p><br><p>They are also known to intentionally interfere with video and image recordings, causing static disruptions, and have the ability to destroy electronic devices by staying in proximity.</p><br><p><strong>The Neighborhood Watch</strong> consists of three distinct categories of beings: <strong>Watchers</strong>, <strong>Striders</strong>, and <strong>Swimmers</strong>.</p><br><p>An image of a <strong>watcher</strong><br/>\nrecovered from a dusty phone.</p><br><p><strong>Watchers</strong> are characterized by their gigantic eyeball-like structures with multiple optic veins protruding from their surfaces. They appear to levitate effortlessly at walking speeds and silently glide over the suburban areas of <span class=\"customlink\"><a href=\"/level-9\">Level 9</a></span>, searching for life.</p><br><p>Upon spotting prey, <strong>watchers</strong> emit a beam of light from their pupils that instantly turns any living matter fully absorbed in the light into fine, gray dust. This light only affects living things and does not harm other instances of <strong>Entity 96</strong>.</p><br><p>There have been many online reports that victims retain their consciousness throughout this process, leading to physical and mental anguish, but they are unbased, as any who are turned to dust are unable to communicate.</p><br><p>Additionally, the surfaces of <strong>watchers</strong> are highly resilient, rendering conventional weaponry ineffective against them. There has never been a documented case of a <strong>watcher</strong> being destroyed by any type of man-made tool, weapon, or object. Wanderers are encouraged not to engage whenever they spot a <strong>watcher</strong>, or use backrooms objects such as <span class=\"customlink\"><a href=\"/object-15\">Firesalt</a></span> to destroy them.</p><br><p><strong>Striders</strong> possess six 8-foot appendages composed of choroid, nerves, and veins centralized under their main eyeball. The main body is less resistant than that of a <strong>watcher's</strong>, allowing ranged weaponry to be effective against them. However, using firearms or <span class=\"customlink\"><a href=\"/object-15\">Firesalt</a></span> can attract the attention of nearby entities.</p><br><p><strong>Striders</strong> are remarkably flexible despite their size, which makes them expert hunters and allows them to reach into buildings, making hiding in shallow rooms unadvisable.</p><br><p>They have been recorded reaching speeds of up to 90 mph, making them impossible to outrun. They are the most vigilant of the three, often seen looking into buildings and using their arms to grab beings hiding inside. When they locate a wanderer or entity, they use their arms to grab hold of and pummel their target onto nearby surfaces until they expire.</p><br><p><strong>Swimmers</strong>, the smallest category of <strong>The Neighborhood Watch</strong>, are roughly the size of a dog and are adapted to aquatic life. They possess a soft, flexible, yet strong muscle structure that allows them to navigate tight spaces, such as pipes and hoses.</p><br><p>With eight optic nerves arranged similarly to octopi, <strong>swimmers</strong> can crawl out of water to slowly chase any organism they spot in an attempt to destroy them. Despite their small stature, they can latch onto victims with great strength and will attempt to submerge and drown them. If drowning is not an option, they will resort to tearing off exposed appendages in order to incapacitate their prey. After a kill, they abandon the corpse and continue searching for intruders.</p><br><p><strong>The Neighborhood Watch</strong> entities are considered extremely dangerous. They exhibit medium levels of intelligence and are capable of tracking down wanderers and occasionally creating ambushes by leading them into one another. These entities also use the dark and unpredictable environment of the backrooms to their advantage, making themselves less visible.</p><br><p>Bringing <span class=\"customlink\"><a href=\"/object-51\">Pockets</a></span> into <span class=\"customlink\"><a href=\"/level-9\">Level 9</a></span> is not advisable as they will immediately alert <strong>The Neighborhood Watch</strong> to your location. The cause for this is undetermined but may be related to their desirability among wanderers, and the exposed areas they appear in. After retrieval of a pocket, either a <strong>strider</strong> or a <strong>swimmer</strong> will collect the artifact and return it to its original area and resume patrolling the level. No other known object exhibits this property.</p><br><p>Example of Unknown Level.</p><br><p>Efforts to surveil <span class=\"customlink\"><a href=\"/level-9\">Level 9</a></span> using electronic devices have consistently failed due to the unique nature of <strong>Entity 96</strong>.</p><br><p>When near <strong>Entity 96</strong>, electronic devices are prone to corruption. Even brief exposure can lead to screen malfunctions, distorted audio, and erratic behavior. Over time, devices become completely unresponsive and irreparably damaged. Sometimes, they fill with random images and audio, including unfamiliar creatures and places presumed to be in the backrooms, along with static and music. However, the reliability and origin of these files remain unknown.</p><br><p>Relying on electronic equipment is not only futile but also dangerous, increasing the risk of harm due to their unpredictable performance. Malfunctioning equipment may also attract other entities.</p><br><p>The following is a multitude of tests conducted by placing streaming devices in different areas of <span class=\"customlink\"><a href=\"/level-9\">Level 9</a></span> to discover how they are affected by Entity 96.</p><br><p>The exact time they were discovered is uncertain, but the Lost possess old deteriorated records that describe their characteristics and title them \"The Ones That Gaze Into Souls\".</p><br><p><iframe allowtransparency=\"true\" class=\"html-block-iframe\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"/entity-96/html/a36db64325280cb340f6f4bc6bd6041afa7d1c65-19726590441037998361\"></iframe></p><br><p><iframe allowtransparency=\"true\" class=\"html-block-iframe\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"/entity-96/html/c96485ca47e74a7006a5bb4e5dc18f74b8e86fb5-1633547740526510373\"></iframe></p><br><p><span class=\"customlink\">Rewritten by: <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/ruebekit\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6908706); return false;\"><img alt=\"Ruebekit\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=6908706&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334069\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=6908706)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/ruebekit\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6908706); return false;\">Ruebekit</a></span><br/>\nOriginal Author: <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/yummer-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6709720); return false;\"><img alt=\"yummer_1\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=6709720&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334069\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=6709720)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/yummer-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6709720); return false;\">yummer_1</a></span><br/>\n<br/>\nAwesome Critters:<br/>\nDiscord - picklez#2172<br/>\nDiscord - Derrick770#9623<br/>\nDiscord - inspyration#0322<br/>\nDiscord - John John Johnson#8720<br/>\nDiscord - User Unhacked#7046</span></p><br><p>Greenlighter:<br/>\nDiscord - captaiin#4444<br/>\n<br/>\nImages:<br/>\n<a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/2nxRvmh\" target=\"_blank\">'The Dark Neighborhood'</a> taken by <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/tyler-allen-edwards\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7351554); return false;\"><img alt=\"Tyler Allen edwards\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7351554&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334069\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7351554)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/tyler-allen-edwards\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7351554); return false;\">Tyler Allen edwards</a></span> is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0.<br/>\nThe Dark Neighborhood edited by DrawzALot(Sydney) Discord - DrawzALot#9859.<br/>\n<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/Gxz0D6T0eRU\">\"Eyeball Statue Near Building\"</a> is licensed under the Unsplash license.<br/>\n<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/-0J8oBmqbRg\">\"Gray Concrete Road Surrounded With Tall And Green Trees During Nighttime\"</a> is licensed under the Unsplash license.<br/>\n<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/pcZvxrAyYoQ\">\"Dark Pathway Lit With Small Light Fixture \"</a> is licensed under the Unsplash license.<br/>\nUnknownLevels 1 thru 3 taken by me and licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0.</p><br><p>\u00ab <span class=\"customlink\"><a href=\"/entity-95\">Entity 95</a></span> | Entity 96 | <span class=\"customlink\"><a href=\"/entity-97\">Entity 97</a></span> \u00bb</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/entity-96\">Entity 96</a>\" by Ruebekit, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

    "description": "<p><strong>Scream Eaters</strong> are humanoid creatures, similar to old legends of ghosts in the Frontrooms albeit with several differences. They have no organs or central nervous system, instead being made out of <strong>Liquid Silence</strong> and nothing else. They are solitary creatures that aimlessly wander for many years at a time, before eventually having to feed.</p><br><p><strong>Scream Eaters</strong> have no discernable legs or feet, and a long ragged hood and cloak formed from Liquid Silence disguises their true features. They levitate a foot off the ground generally, and their face is an inky web of <strong>Liquid Silence</strong>, with two gaping holes representing their eyes. A picture of a Scream Eater has never been taken, due to them only being seen in extremely poor weather conditions.</p><br><p>Four tentacles up to an inch in diameter can erupt from the <strong>Scream Eater's</strong> body at will, moving at very quick speeds in order to trap their prey. Many thinner inky tentacles emerge from where a mouth would normally be on a human, waving around gently midair. It is theorised that <strong>Scream Eaters</strong> locate their prey and study their surroundings with these tentacled appendages, as they do not have noses or eyes. <strong>Scream Eaters</strong> use their mouth tentacles as a primary feeding apparatus as well.</p><br><p><strong>Scream Eaters</strong> cause emotional changes in most entities up to thirty meters away. Initial uncomfortableness or a sense of being watched develops into full blown hysteria and screaming within half a meter. This fear inducing capability is used by <strong>Scream Eaters</strong> to feed. They also have the ability to phase through thin walls and objects, however this capability is not represented in <strong>Liquid Silence</strong> for an unknown reason.</p><br><p><strong>Scream Eaters</strong> are generally harmless, able to survive for decades on one meal<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup>. It is impossible to kill <strong>Scream Eaters</strong> who have not recently fed, due to them being composed of sound-poor <strong>Liquid Silence</strong>.</p><br><p>Once hungry, <strong>Scream Eaters</strong> will roam during blizzards and hunt down stray entities. After trapping them with their four thick tentacles, they will envelop the entity with their mouth appendages, clutching the entity's head tightly and holding the rest of the body still with the four torso tentacles. According to survivors, several of these thinner tentacles are forcibly shoved down victims' esophagi, and can leave a film of <strong>Liquid Silence</strong> for many months, preventing the survivor from making loud noises.</p><br><p>Due to the fear inducing capabilities of <strong>Scream Eaters</strong>, victims will begin to exhibit extreme hysteria once trapped. This includes behavior such as screaming, thrashing and crying. <strong>Scream Eaters</strong> absorb all sound produced from this using their web of mouth tentacles over the victim's head. This means a victim of a <strong>Scream Eater</strong> will not be able to alert others to their predicament, no matter how loud they shout for help. After up to three days of intense screaming and fear, eventually the <strong>Scream Eater</strong> will detach. The victim's vocal chords are often left with irreparable damage, as well as their mind. Often the victim will die due to the extreme temperatures where <strong>Scream Eaters</strong> are found. Surviving victims have severe mental damage and often become <strong><a href=\"/entity-15\">Wretches</a></strong> within two to three hours after a Scream Eater has finished. Meals can last up a decade before a <strong>Scream</strong> Eater has to feed again.</p><br><p>A recently fed <strong>Scream Eater</strong> will have a large amount of soundwaves stored within its body. The special properties of <strong>Liquid Silence</strong> - what a <strong>Scream Eater's</strong> body is made of, can be applied in this scenario. Simply run an electrical current of 1 volt or more through the <strong>Scream Eater</strong>. Be wary, as the creature will spontaneously detonate with a power ranging from a hand grenade to a small bomb. <strong>Liquid Silence</strong> can be collected from the remains. Because a <strong>Scream Eater</strong> has only a single weakness, it is considered extremely dangerous when hostile.</p><br><p><strong>Scream Eaters</strong> were first discovered by M.E.G. search team 09-3. Records recovered from their short stay in level 93 before their eventual deaths speak about faint humanoid shadows in the distance. Later teams documented <strong>Scream Eaters</strong> in more depth, discovering the properties of <strong>Liquid Silence</strong> and the hunting behaviors of <strong>Scream Eaters</strong>.</p><br><p>Not enough is known about the general behavior and reactions of <strong>Scream Eaters</strong> outside of feeding, so there are no definitive recommendations on how to approach or deal with a <strong>Scream Eater</strong>.</p><br><p>The author of this article is <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/atom-rutherford\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6877920); return false;\"><img alt=\"Atom_Rutherford\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=6877920&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334066\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=6877920)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/atom-rutherford\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6877920); return false;\">Atom_Rutherford</a></span>.</p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/entity-96\">Entity 96</a> | Entity 97 | <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/entity-98\">Entity 98</a> \u00bb</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/entity-97\">Scream Eaters</a>\" by Atom_Rutherford, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

    "description": "<p>Entity 99, better known as \"The Game Master\", is a jester-like puppet with a high level of control over reality within <a href=\"/level-389\">The Gaming Hall</a>. She is known for tricking people into entering her level and challenging them to a game of their choice.</p><br><p>The Game Master is a sentient entity with an erratic personality. Her consistently documented behaviors include the verbal usage of internet slang, referencing recent popular media and \"memes\", difficulty accepting defeat, and a tendency to manipulate wanderers into playing games with her.</p><br><p>While in her idle state, The Game Master is most commonly seen lying face-down on the floor of Level 389, but there have also been recorded instances of her playing video games, watching videos, or speaking to herself near the curtains at the back of the level.</p><br><p>The Game Master has shown pride in her diverse catalog of playable games. Although she insists that the games are her own original creations, they bear suspicious similarities to those existing in <a href=\"/the-frontrooms\">The Frontrooms</a>. Despite claiming to be a stickler for rules, she has been proven to frequently attempt to cheat in her own games to gain further advantages. Additionally, although The Game Master claims otherwise, almost all of the games tend to be structured in such a way that the outcome favors her.</p><br><p>The Game Master's face consists of a glass screen that digitally displays two red Xs for eyes and a cartoonish smile by default, though it can also display various other expressions. The rest of The Game Master's body is a patchwork of blue and yellow fabric, stuffed with what is presumed to be cotton.</p><br><p>The Game Master's extremities appear to be crafted from wood \u2014 typical of a marionette puppet. Small red spheres that emit a squeaking sound are attached to the tips of her jester hat, the ends of her shoes, and the middle of her torso. The wrists, ankles, and other various parts of her body are suspended by red strings, the source of which is untraceable as they seem to extend infinitely.</p><br><p>It is unknown when The Game Master first appeared or was first discovered. Interviews with survivors who have explored The Gaming Hall have reported the existence of various games from as far back as the early 1900s in her catalog. Even older games and items have been reported, but are yet to be documented. The Game Master herself only comments that such games are \"old and boring\".</p><br><p>She was first recorded to be active around ten years ago, when several people reported seeing a checkerboard-patterned door before them. Said witnesses were reported missing shortly thereafter.</p><br><p>Interestingly, <a href=\"/the-lost\">The Lost</a> are known to have worshipped a deity in their <a href=\"/the-pantheon\">pantheon</a> known as \"<a href=\"/komo-oide-and-philia\">Nunca</a>\". Many details about this being strikingly resemble those of The Game Master, from the jester-like motif, to the eccentric mannerisms, to the jovial demeanor. This may suggest that The Game Master has a far more ancient origin than initially believed, but confirmation of this theory is still pending.</p><br><p>There have been reports of The Game Master talking to an unknown individual near the curtains of Level 389. It is unknown what both were discussing, but it is notable for the following incident:</p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:90%;\">9<sup>th</sup> March 2020 <strong>14:27</strong></span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:130%;\"><strong>Game Master audio log</strong></span> <span style=\"font-size:90%;\">&lt;<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">ccdd178@gmail.com</span>&gt;</span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:90%;\">to &lt;<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">mandb@majorexplorergroup.com</span>&gt;</span></p><br><p>Hi silly!

I explained everything I needed to.</p><br><p><strong>Player:</strong> Fine.

So this property? Can I buy it?</p><br><p><strong>Game Master:</strong> Yes, yes, of course. It\u2019s just a real expensive one! Don\u2019t lose all your money in one go!</p><br><p><strong>Player:</strong> I can afford I think. And you might land on it soon, so I\u2019ll get rent on um\u2026 The Egg Street?

Entity 100 also may just be a pitch black creature or missing parts of clothing mentioned.

    "title": "- \"The Squires\"",
    "description": "<p>Illustration based on a M.E.G operative's eyewitness account. He had encountered the fourth squire on Level 38 and then was brought to the others.</p><br><p><strong>Entity 101</strong>, also known as the Squires, are a group of four humanoid entities averaging a height of around five feet (with the exception of the fourth squire, who is estimated to be 4 feet and 8 inches). The Squires are adorned with suits of armor that appear to have originated from 14th\u201316th-century Europe, and they each possess a unique weapon that they display proficiency in the use of. The first squire wields a sword and shield, the second squire wields a two-handed battle axe, the third squire wields a spear, and the fourth squire wields a pair of daggers.</p><br><p>According to the Squires themselves, each of them possess a 'souvenir' that is attributed in some way to <a href=\"/entity-71\">The Red Knight</a>, having recovered them from the sites of battles with the infamous entity in their aftermath. The first squire possesses a torn piece of the Red Knight's cape, which he uses as a scarf. The second squire has a fragment of the Red Knight's blade welded onto the blade of his axe. The third squire wears the left gauntlet of the Red Knight, which has been fitted to his own hand. Similar to the third squire, the fourth squire wears one of the Red Knight's shoulder pauldrons, fitted to her own body.</p><br><p>Additionally, the second squire has been shown to be in possession of an amulet that is wrapped around his gauntlet. The amulet has a golden trim and holds an emerald gem. It is believed to be the source of the Squires' ability to travel around the Backrooms so easily. Based on the accounts of wanderers that have been saved by the Squires, the emerald would glow, and the Squires would radiate a green aura of the same as the emerald, before the second squire would raise his hand and a rift to another level would open. However, there does not seem to be much conscious control over the destination, as wanderers have reported being teleported to levels that were even more dangerous than the one they were previously in. Furthermore, this artifact is actually not believed to be associated with the Red Knight, and its true source is yet to be identified.</p><br><p>The Squires have made their best efforts to prove their friendliness to wanderers. Their goal is much like that of the Red Knight, in that they wish to help people who have fallen into The Backrooms and protect them from possible dangers. They have risked their own lives to defend wanderers at times, exhibiting a sense of honor and bravery.<br/>\nStrangely, whenever the squires are not occupied by their duties, all of them except for the second squire have a child-like, innocent and playful demeanor. On an individual basis, each squire has their own unique personality:</p><br><p>As a whole, the Squires seem very close, referring to each other \"brother\" and \"sister\". This seems to suggest that the squires share a bond akin to that of militaristic comradery. They work together like a well-oiled machine in combat, being able to overwhelm opponents despite their shorter stature. However, they often end up battered and bruised in the aftermath, sometimes having to to drag one of their own to safety. But even after all that, they take pride in their victories and celebrate in their own time. Even if they are unable to kill the threat, they will attempt to weaken it as much as possible, then retreat to another level.</p><br><p>The Squires are humanoid in shape; however, the full extent of their humanity cannot be determined. This is due in part to their refusal to remove their armor, whether by choice or inability to do so. Relative to the capabilities of an average human, the Squires have enhanced speed, strength and agility. Even with such enhancements, they may still struggle against their more violent and ruthless opponents. They can sustain heavy damage in battle, and seem to make a full recovery quite quickly. It is theorized that the Squires' abilities are connected in some way to the Red Knight, though this is yet to be confirmed.</p><br><p>The Squires have only surfaced recently, with the first sighting of them having been documented about eight months ago. A lot of firsthand accounts have reported the Squires saving wanderers from other entities, or simply roaming levels. They have been sighted in almost every level.</p><br><p>When encountering the Squires, there are several things that can be done to earn their respect. The Squires enjoy having fun in their leisure time, so playing along with their games can serve as a teambuilding exercise. One may earn the third squire's respect by fighting alongside him in battle, as he seems to love wanderers with a fighting spirit. the Squires as a group love telling stories, especially the fourth one. Therefore, sharing one's own stories is another way to earn their respect.</p><br><p>It is theorized that the Squires may be emulating the Red Knight in an attempt to gain his attention. However, most of them except for the fourth squire have been shown to dislike comparisons to the Red Knight. It is therefore not advised to mention the Red Knight around them.</p><br><p><span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/commiepyro\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(8378835); return false;\"><img alt=\"CommiePyro\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=8378835&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334074\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=8378835)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/commiepyro\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(8378835); return false;\">CommiePyro</a></span></p><br><p>Art drawn by <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/litterbug\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7753771); return false;\"><img alt=\"litterbug\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7753771&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334074\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7753771)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/litterbug\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7753771); return false;\">litterbug</a></span>.</p><br><p>CSS by <span class=\"printuser\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/scutoid-studios\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(8055329); return false;\">scutoid studios</a></span> .<br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:75%;\"><span class=\"scutoid\">(omfg i actually love these little guys so much ~ scutoid)</span></span><br/>\nhere's my authorpage: <a href=\"/scutoid\">click</a></p><br><p>Revisions and critique corrections applied by <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/mctoran\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(8896141); return false;\"><img alt=\"Mctoran\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=8896141&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334074\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=8896141)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/mctoran\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(8896141); return false;\">Mctoran</a></span>.</p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/entity-100\">Entity 100</a> | Entity 101 | <a href=\"/entity-102\">Entity 102</a> \u00bb</p><br>",

    "description": "<p>The following is an interview between a <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-m-e-g\">M.E.G.</a> investigator (operating under the codename \"Robert Joseph\".), and John Walter, one of the only known survivors of an encounter with Entity 102.</p><br><p><strong>Begin Log: 17:45</strong><br/>\n<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Robert Joseph<br/>\n<strong>Interviewee:</strong> John Walter</p><br><p><strong>Robert:</strong> Good afternoon, this is M.E.G investigator \"Robert Joseph\". Could you please state your name and your age for the M.E.G's records?<br/></p><br><p><strong>John:</strong> My name is John Walter, and I am 27 years old.<br/></p><br><p><strong>Robert:</strong> Alright, let's begin with the interview then, do you remember which level you were in when you encountered Entity 102?<br/></p><br><p><strong>John:</strong> what? No, What's a level? Is this some sort of video game??<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Robert:</strong> Uhh\u2026how do I explain it\u2026, just describe the surroundings of the place where you encountered Entity 102.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>John:</strong> okay, umm, I remember\u2026i-it was dark\u2026, had concrete floors and walls.., isolated rooms and hallways\u2026.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Robert:</strong> You seem to be describing <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-1\">Level 1</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>John:</strong> <em>(confused stare)</em> \u2026What?<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Robert:</strong> Nothing, do you remember for how long you've been in the Backrooms?<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>John:</strong> I had been wandering for what felt like hours, but I had lost all sense of time in that place\u2026<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Robert:</strong> Very well, can you describe your encounter in detail?<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>John:</strong> Yeah, s-sure. I remember it v-vividly, Uhh\u2026 So,\u2026 I..I was wandering in the Backrooms when I saw this mysterious figure staring at me from a distance, someone was standing there, or\u2026. S-something, it looked like a human but it was missing\u2026 a head.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Robert:</strong> And did you try to get a closer look at the figure?<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>John:</strong> Yes, I did. I tried to get a clear view of the figure, but the more I looked at it, the more unnerved I became. It was a headless person, dressed in a formal black suit and holding a bloody crowbar in his right hand.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Robert:</strong> Well, would you be able to draw a rough sketch of the entity? It would make things a little easier for us to visualise.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>John:</strong> S-sure, I can draw it\u2026 I guess\u2026.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>(A pen and a piece of paper is provided to John for drawing.)</em><br/>\n<br/>\n<em>(John holds the pencil, closes his eyes for a few seconds, then opens them, staring at the paper before starting to draw.)</em><br/>\n<br/>\n<em>(John finishes the sketch with a few notable parts of the entity labelled.)</em><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>John:</strong> Here\u2026. This is what I saw.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Robert:</strong> That looks terrifying. What did you do next?<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>John:</strong> I felt uneasy and tried to move away, but the entity started moving towards me, I panicked and ran for my life\u2026<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Robert:</strong> How did the entity behave during the encounter?<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>John:</strong> It just stared at me\u2026 and started moving towards me with the crowbar\u2026, It was as if it was hunting me down. It was very creepy and unsettling..<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Robert:</strong> Did the entity say or do anything that you found notable?<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>John:</strong> No, it didn't say anything, didn't I tell you it was missing a fucking head!<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Robert:</strong> I am aware, I just wanted to know if it had any other\u2026 Nevermind. Anyways, how did you manage to escape?<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>John:</strong> I rounded another corner and found myself a little space between the walls to hide in. I slid in and patiently waited for it to leave\u2026 I stayed there for what felt like an eternity, listening for any sign of the entity. Then I heard a loud crashing noise and the sound of footsteps retreating into the darkness. I turned around and the figure was gone\u2026<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Robert:</strong> That's a very interesting detail, Can you tell me more about the sound that distracted the headless entity?<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>John:</strong> Yes, it was a sudden loud noise that came from a different direction. I'm not sure what caused it, but I think it might have been a door slamming shut or something falling over.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Robert:</strong> And, how did you find this document?<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>John:</strong> I followed the sound to investigate what might have caused it. That's when I stumbled upon a group of researchers and guards lying dead on the floor. They all had their blood drained out, the entity must've killed them. One of the researchers was holding this document in his hand, it was drenched in blood\u2026. I was able to retrieve it despite the blood.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Robert:</strong> Very well, this is enough for now. Thank you for your cooperation. We may need to follow up with you in the future, but for now, this concludes the interview.</p><br><p><strong>End Log: 17:57</strong></p><br><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Warning:</strong></p><br><p>Any individuals who encounter Entity 102 are to be immediately evacuated from the area.</p><br><p>Personnel are advised to be extremely cautious when entering areas that Entity 102 is suspected to linger frequently.</p><br><p>Labelled sketch of Entity 102 drawn by John Walter during the interview.</p><br><p><strong>Entity Number:</strong> #102</p><br><p>All previous assumptions on Entity 102's habitat have turned out incorrect. The entity is assumed to travel to different levels in search of prey, most commonly levels with little to no light.</p><br><p>Entity 102 is a headless humanoid entity that stands at approximately 2 meters in height. The entity can be commonly found wearing a formal black suit and holding a blood stained crowbar in its hand. It wears a sleek black suit with a white undershirt and a black tie, all of which never seem to be stained with blood or dirt despite the dank and bloody environment it inhabits. Yet, according to the eye witnesses, its hands always seem to be caked in the thick, sticky, rotting blood of it's victims; never drying or washing off. It is observed that Entity 102 cannot be eliminated through the use of firearms or any other methods of physical harm, as its physical form appears to be impervious to destruction. It is capable of moving at incredible speeds and has shown a high level of physical strength and intelligence.</p><br><p>Entity 102 will brutally injure anyone it encounters until they start to bleed heavily, it will then pour their blood into its headless neck cavity until all the blood in the victim's body is exsanguinated. The entity appears to take pleasure in inflicting pain and will often toy with its victims before killing them. Entity 102 has been observed to avoid attacking children below 13 years of age. It is suspected that Entity 102 may have some form of moral code. The reasons for this behavior are unclear, but there could be several possible explanations.</p><br><p>One possibility is that the entity recognizes the vulnerability of young children and avoids attacking them out of a sense of compassion or empathy. Alternatively, the entity may have a moral code that values the innocence of children and views attacking them as morally wrong.</p><br><p>It is also possible that the entity's avoidance of children is based on practical considerations. Children may be more difficult to catch than adults, and attacking them may increase the risk of detection or retaliation by other humans.</p><br><p>Whatever the reasons for this behavior, the fact that Entity 102 appears to avoid attacking children below 13 years of age suggests that it is capable of making moral or ethical judgments about its actions.</p><br><p>The Entity also deliberately leaves a trail of bloody footsteps as a means of deceiving its prey and luring them into its trap. This behavior is likely a predatory tactic, used to increase the entity's chances of successfully catching its prey.</p><br><p>By leaving a trail of bloody footsteps, the entity may be attempting to create the impression that it is injured or vulnerable, thereby encouraging the prey to approach it. The prey may perceive the entity as an easy target, and let down their guard, making it easier for the entity to launch a surprise attack.</p><br><p>Alternatively, the entity may be intentionally misleading the prey by creating a false trail. The bloody footprints could lead the prey in a certain direction, only to suddenly diverge or disappear entirely, leaving the prey disoriented and vulnerable to attack.</p><br><p>Overall, this behavior suggests that the entity is intelligent and adaptable, using deception and misdirection to improve its chances of catching prey.</p><br><p>Entity 102 is known to lurk in specific dark places, such as abandoned buildings and underground tunnels, searching for victims. It has been reported to move quickly and silently, making it difficult to detect. Entity-102 appears to be attracted to areas with low light levels and has shown a particular interest in areas with a history of violent deaths.</p><br><p>Entity 102 appears to have standard human biology. Though it is unclear how Entity 102 is able to see its prey or function properly without a head. Not much information is available about this entity; this document will be updated as further knowledge is acquired about the entity.</p><br><p>Discovery Log: Entity 102 \"The Headless Hunter\"</p><br><p>Date: 10/02/2023</p><br><p>Location: Level-1</p><br><p>Entity 102, colloquially referred to as \"The Headless Hunter,\" was first encountered on Level 1 of the Backrooms by a group of M.E.G researchers. The entity's physical description and behavior were observed and recorded during three research expeditions, two of which were successful.</p><br><p>The physical description and behavior of Entity 102 were closely monitored during the first two research expeditions. Entity 102 exhibited highly aggressive behavior, attacking anything within its line of sight or anything that produced sound within its range.</p><br><p>During the third research expedition, the team aimed to study the biology of Entity 102. However, the mission ended tragically. An equipment's unknown malfunctioning accidentally produced a loud crashing noise that attracted the attention of Entity 102. As a result, Entity 102 attacked the team, resulting in the loss of all researchers. The failure of the mission prevented any further exploration of Entity 102's biology.</p><br><p>This document is an updated copy of the original document that was recovered from the Backrooms.</p><br><p><strong>Notice:</strong> Not much information is available on Entity 102, we are still gathering information about it's behaviour and origins. Until then, it is advised to remain vigilant and cautious at all times while exploring the backrooms to avoid falling victim to it's tactics.</p><br><p>This article is a result of the horrific imagination of:</p><br><p>~ <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-avenlee\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(8258295);

    "title": "- \"The Keymaster\"",
    "description": "<p>\u2800</p><br><p><strong>Entity X</strong>, colloquially titled \u201cThe Keymaster,\u201d is a being that resides in <a href=\"/the-hub\">The Hub</a>, serving as its overseer. He is best known for providing <a href=\"/object-2\">Level Keys</a> to wanderers in his travels through The Backrooms, assisting in the escape of levels that they are trapped within. Simultaneously pervasive and obscure, he has been sighted in practically every level of The Backrooms \u2014 yet eludes those who attempt to discover more about him.</p><br><p>Over time, The Keymaster\u2019s visual description has varied diversely between reports \u2014 primarily regarding the color of his skin, hair, and eyes. Said attributes will briefly remain consistent for varying timespans, before becoming slightly altered yet again. Such discrepancies aside, a series of underlying details remain consistent: he is a male humanoid figure with long wiry hair, standing near 6\u201910\" and shrouded in a cloak obscuring everything below the top half of his face. A faint dark mist of indeterminate properties proceeds his movements at waist-height, briefly remaining in trodden locations before dissipating. The most prominent trademark of his appearance is a large ring of keys attached to his right hip. The keys appear worn and ancient, but also ornate, with runic symbols inscribed onto them.</p><br><p>\u2800</p><br><p>The Keymaster's most notable trait is his apparent access to every level key in The Backrooms. He will generate a key by materializing it, though it is unknown whether this is accomplished by summoning the keys from a location or creating them at that moment. Given the extent of The Keymaster's accessibility to level keys and the intertwined nature between them, he is presumed to be their sole creator, proprietor and distributor. The level keys themselves typically take the form of a conventional <a href=\"/the-frontrooms\">frontrooms</a> key. However, in certain instances, keys are manifested in more abstract forms, unpredictable in function. They may even present themselves as other objects or entities. With his keys, The Keymaster can not only unlock any level, but also <em>lock</em> them as well. He will typically lock the doors between levels upon crossing them, so as to prevent other entities from freely moving through The Backrooms.</p><br><p>An additional ability possessed by The Keymaster, although not as noteworthy among the rest, is what seems to be a specialized form of <a href=\"/phenomenon-5\">no-clipping</a> that allows him to clip anywhere within a given level at will, although he cannot clip out of a level itself. The only way he seems to be able to intentionally pass through levels is by manually unlocking them, except for instances of sleep-induced teleportation (which is randomized and beyond his control).</p><br><p>Despite possessing a need for sleep, The Keymaster is strongly averted to it and will stave it off for as long as possible. According to witness reports, he will dematerialize and disappear upon succumbing to fatigue and losing consciousness \u2014 only to later reappear in a random level. It is speculated that his weariness/confusion are likely narcoleptic symptoms as the result of avoiding sleep.</p><br><p>By all accounts, The Keymaster cannot be destroyed, or at least can always come back from his destruction. He has been reportedly \"destroyed\" on several occasions, only to subsequently resurface in another level with a newly reported sighting. Accompanying this subsequent sighting is a change in personality and appearance. There have been no such instances of destruction recorded since 2014.</p><br><p>\u2800</p><br><p>Coinciding with the changes in his appearance, The Keymaster has exhibited a diverse range of behaviors in reported encounters. Generally, however, he is a quiet and soft-spoken individual, often in a state of weariness or confusion.</p><br><p>Wanderers who encounter The Keymaster may request a key from him. As per a personal code, he will only allow a wanderer to receive one key ever, and will not manifest another, even if the first key was somehow lost/destroyed. His supposed reasoning behind this is that he \"does not wish to take responsibility for more liabilities than necessary\". Although the key's resonance will naturally lead the wanderer to its respective door, The Keymaster will nonetheless follow the wanderer, protecting them and ensuring a safe passage along their path, as well as revealing the door once it is reached.</p><br><p>If an altercation occurs, most commonly with hostile entities, The Keymaster will not hesitate to defend himself, and neutralizes his opponents rather quickly. However, he does not typically kill his assailants, instead banishing them <a href=\"/level-help\">elsewhere</a> with the use of a certain key on his key ring.</p><br><p>When interacting with The Keymaster, it is best to exhibit a neutral demeanor at minimum towards him, as he will not be malicious if left unprovoked. If one is inexperienced with navigating The Backrooms or interacting with its denizens, then maintaining a safe distance would be more advisable to prevent loss of life from negligence.</p><br><p>\u2800</p><br><p>The first modern sighting of The Keymaster took place in The Hub, in which he helped guide wanderers to a certain level. However, there is strong evidence to suggest that the his existence in The Backrooms dates back far earlier, given his parallels to a certain <a href=\"/phenomenon-10\">god</a> in <a href=\"/the-pantheon\">the pantheon</a> of <a href=\"/the-lost\">The Lost</a>. A file on this being may be found below:</p><br><p><a href=\"/entity-103/offset/2\">Lost Archive: Gatekeeper</a></p><br><p>There are several theories in regards to Entity X's true nature and origins. Detailed below are the four most prominent ones:</p><br><p>It is popularly speculated that The Keymaster was once a wanderer himself, before experiencing a certain fate that made him what he currently is. This may be likely, considering the many cases of human wanderers becoming entities after being transformed by other entities, if not a level itself. The explanation would lend to his more relatively humanoid nature and appearance compared to most other entities.</p><br><p>This theory postulates that The Keymaster is/was not only one, but in fact multiple individuals.<br/>\nThose who subscribe to this theory believe that The Keymaster draws his abilities from the cloak he wears, although he himself may not be aware. When he dies, another being finds his cloak \u2014 or perhaps the cloak finds them. Upon the cloak attaching to them, they become the new Keymaster, with all the entailed abilities. This may lend to the inconsistencies between recorded interactions.</p><br><p>Another theory is that The Keymaster was created as part of a test/experiment performed by a greater, more powerful entity. This is supported by the fact that his abilities occasionally malfunction. If he were experimental, then there could be room for error and failure, just as with all experiments.</p><br><p>Others posit that The Keymaster is simply a force of nature. He always was, is, and will be, and may be tied to the very nature of the Backrooms themselves or even transcend it.

    "description": "<p>Entity 104, also known as Photoshop, is a block-like creature found near a desktop computer. This entity is very aggressive around anyone, so it is suggested that you remain cautious when approaching Photoshop by keeping a safe distance. The entity can be found in any level with a desktop, but the first sighting of Photoshop was in <a href=\"/level-2\">Level 2</a> in Office Space EL3A.</p><br><p>Photoshop is an entity with unusual abilities. It appears as non-threatening from afar, but if anyone gets within a 5ft. radius anywhere around the entity, a large, transparent box with black edges will surround them. Any matter that passes through the walls of this box will be destroyed as if the entity is cropping it out of existence. The entity doesn't attack if you take a picture of it with a camera, even if up-close. It is theorized that this entity might want attention and praise. If you place an object in front of Photoshop, a large, white, and bloody arm will come out of the computer and grab the object into the screen. After this, the object will be seen on the monitor. If Photoshop has enough items, it will materialize the objects from the desktop screen, change the hue with dark red, and use them as legs to move around. The entity will not attack you if you give it an item and will find its prey somewhere else.</p><br><p>The entity has two photos of eyes, a picture of a Pitbull's mouth wide open for its face. For its body, it has a block that has a photograph of flesh on all sides. The images for the eyes and face are completely flat. The entire body looks blocky and has a glitching effect to it. Photoshop has an estimated height of 7'9\".</p><br><p>It was found by a wanderer that no-clipped in Level 2. The wanderer kept her distance from Photoshop and tried finding the exit somewhere else. It's unclear when the entity came to level 2. She told other wanderers about the entity in Office Space EL3A. The wanderers were very interested and went to research the entity. When they found the entity, they brought a test dummy with them to see what it does. They placed the dummy in front of Photoshop, got out of the way, and that's when they found out about the cropping attack. The Wanderers retreated in the moment of fright and escaped safely.</p><br><p>One other wanderer found out that the entity didn't attack when he had a camera on him, and took a picture of Photoshop. He also discovered that it was dangerous when another wanderer tried attacking it and was cropped out of existence.</p><br><p><strong>Date:</strong> 12/14/2020<br/>\n<strong>Interviewer: David Robinson</strong></p><br><p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> Michael Jones</p><br><p><strong>&lt;Begins Interview&gt;</strong></p><br><p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> So, Michael, what was this thing you saw in the Level 2?</p><br><p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> Well\u2026It was a\u2026statue that looked like nothing I would imagine seeing. Like seriously, that fucking thing is\u2026I don't know. It looked like some class project from hell. Ever since me and my friends got out of there, I've been all shaken up. I almost think all of this was some surreal dream.</p><br><p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Ok. So was the thing alive?</p><br><p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> It sure looked like it. There was\u2026a big, clear box that trapped our dummy. When the box was shrinking, I could see the dummy getting torn up. At that moment, we knew we were dealing with something far more dangerous in that shithole.</p><br><p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Ok. [Cleares throat] Do you plan to go back to research this entity?</p><br><p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> Hell no. There is no way I'm going back there. There were so many other things there that I don't want to discuss.</p><br><p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Like the <a href=\"/entity-3\">Smilers</a>?

    "description": "<p>Shades are large, catlike entities with abnormally long legs. The exact appearance of a shade is often hard to discern, because they prefer to stay in the shadows, and looking at it for too long starts to cause mild hysteria and panic.</p><br><p>Shades aren't exactly hostile, per se. They simply stare from the shadows without attacking. However, the sight of a shade will cause an extreme and irrational fear. Almond water cannot help. A shade's fear can only be counteracted by getting as far away as possible. After running away, the fear stops, but encountering another shade less than three days later will cause an extreme relapse. However, one <em>can</em> use a mirror to look at one, so it is advised to bring one to any levels known to have shades in them, to navigate without the danger of fear.</p><br><p>The shade is a large, feline entity that randomly appear in dark corners, doorways, or anywhere with a noticeable lack of light. Those who encounter it say that its eyes glow, but they might just be extremely reflective, like those of a domestic cat.</p><br><p>The only reports of shades have all come in at about the same time, as if it only recently came into existence.<br/>\nOn 04/12/2019, about five M.E.G. members, all who came from different parts of different levels, ran into <a href=\"/the-hub\">The Hub</a> screaming.

    "description": "<p>Entity 106 appears to be a piece of software named tgochi.exe which appears to be sentient or at least capable of simulating sentience. The main way of obtaining said software is by finding it inside a USB key labeled \"tgochi.exe\". These USB keys constantly appear in various levels of the Backrooms with no clear explanation. The origin of these USB drives, as well as that of the software they contain, remains unknown. There is also a minimal chance of the software being installed without the need for a USB key or any other means every time an electronic device is connected to a power outlet in the Backrooms.</p><br><p>tgochi.exe resembles old Tamagotchi digital pets, but instead of a normal pet, the player will have to take care of a seemingly random agglomerate of pixels characterized by a single big eye. The player will be tasked with keeping it fed and entertained, as the \"Happy\" and \"Hungry\" bars on the bottom of the screen suggest. Unlike a normal digital pet, the pet will not die when these needs are not satisfied. Instead, it will begin verbally abusing the player and insistently telling him to satisfy its needs.<br/>\nThe pet is, in fact, capable of speech through text boxes and will react not only to the player's actions but also to its surroundings. The pet \"talks\" to the player very frequently and is often (if not always) playfully rude and abusive in their regards, to the point of having been defined by many as \"an insufferable prick\".<br/>\nAside from the default screen showing the pet, there are several other screens in tgochi.exe.<br/>\ntgochi.exe players can communicate with each other through the \"chatroom\" screen. It is speculated that there are 400 chatrooms and every single one of them can hold up to 50 players. The chatrooms are very slow and unreliable, though, and many users are thought to be bots.</p><br><p>A screenshot of tgochi.exe's \"Chatrooms\" screen</p><br><p>The achievements screen is the main part of the game. When tgochi.exe is installed on a device, the first thing it will do is tell its player that \"the game consists in a series of challenges under the name of 'achievements'\" and that once a player manages to complete all of the achievements, tgochi.exe will reveal \"a big secret about the Backrooms\". The nature of this secret is currently unknown.<br/>\nThere are about 4,000 achievements to complete. Some of them are straightforward and easy to complete, but most of them are either extremely risky or extremely time consuming. What follows is a list of some of the most well-known achievements.</p><br><p><em>\"Win a fight against 5 entities alone and unarmed\"</em></p><br><p>- - -</p><br><p><em>\"Consume 5 liters (170 oz) of <a href=\"/object-1\">Almond Water</a> in one day\"</em></p><br><p>- - -</p><br><p><em>\"Win a TSR\"</em></p><br><p>- - -</p><br><p><em>\"Observe every known entity in the Backrooms at least once\"</em></p><br><p>- - -</p><br><p>While the <a href=\"/the-m-e-g\">M.E.G.</a> actively advises against participating in tgochi.exe's game, a certain group named \"The Completionists\" appears to be hellbent on completing all the challenges tgochi.exe offers, in hope that the big secret it claims to be in knowedge of is a way to escape the Backrooms and return to <a href=\"/the-frontrooms\">the Frontrooms</a>. While we do recognize that their intentions are good, we still can't allow ourselves to cooperate with them. The Completionists are widely known for their reckless behavior and their general carelessness for what concerns their safety or the safety of people around them. Besides there is no proof of the secret actually being the location of an exit.<br/>\nWe do not consider them a threat and we wil not actively oppose them, but any sort of cooperation with them is strictly forbidden.</p><br><p><span style=\"font: 0.8rem 'Press Start 2P'; line-height: 1.5rem\">yeah yeah youve heard what the nerds have to say about us how about you check THIS out instead</span></p><br><p><span style=\"font: 0.8rem 'Press Start 2P'; line-height: 1.5rem\">- signed the coolest kids in the block aka the completionists</span></p><br><p><a href=\"/the-completionists\">Yes</a></p><br><p>No</p><br><p>A screenshot of tgochi.exe's \"Achievements\" screen</p><br><p>Since 2019 tgochi.exe seems to be pushing its players to provide it (or its Developers) with all the computer equipment they can find. In the in-game \"announcements\" screen, the Developers have announced a new type of challenge, called \"tgochi.exe Support Raid\" or, as it's widely referred to in the community, TSR.<br/>\nTSRs are a timed event where players are randomly assigned to one of four teams and a captain is randomly chosen for each team. Players will be tasked with depositing the highest amount of electronic supplies and components they can find in a specific spot in the Level they currently find themselves in, to then leave them there until the timed event is over. The more they can gather, the more points they will score. When the event ends, the deposited objects will disappear into thin air as soon as no one is observing them.<br/>\nSo far there have been three TSRs. What follows are the rankings of the past editions.</p><br><p><strong>Average Raisin Gamers</strong>, captained by <strong>thegrapemaster43</strong>, with <strong>28,568 points</strong></p><br><p><strong>Skeletal Bone Boys</strong>, captained by <strong>kromathe27th</strong>, with <strong>26,459 points</strong></p><br><p><strong>God's Mistakes</strong>, captained by <strong>bonkui</strong>, with <strong>25,293 points</strong></p><br><p><strong>The Bloodcurdlers</strong>, captained by <strong>xxdarkheartxx</strong> with <strong>22,024 points</strong></p><br><p><strong>Glizzy Crusaders</strong>, captained by <strong>bloodaboy</strong>, with <strong>30,985 points</strong></p><br><p><strong>The Covenant of 11</strong>, captained by <strong>jo958445385</strong>, with <strong>29,059 points</strong></p><br><p><strong>Sorry Couldnt Think of a Good Name :(</strong>, captained by <strong>concretehotdog</strong>, with <strong>26,438 points</strong></p><br><p><strong>The Stan Clan</strong>, captained by <strong>stanleytheimmense</strong> with <strong>26,407 points</strong></p><br><p><strong>Holy Freaking Shot, It's The Spoopy Boys</strong>, captained by <strong>skeletorismyking</strong>, with <strong>29,543 points</strong><br/>\n(The team name was altered by tgochi.exe's anti-profanity filter)</p><br><p><strong>Totally Not Suspicious Group</strong>, captained by <strong>2boysinacomicallylargetrenchcoat</strong>, with <strong>27,587 points</strong></p><br><p><strong>Skinny Peanuts</strong>, captained by <strong>snomgaming</strong>, with <strong>25,664 points</strong><br/>\n(The team name was altered by tgochi.exe's anti-profanity filter)</p><br><p><strong>Runaway Seven (We're Not Actually Seven Tho)</strong>, captained by <strong>masonbasin</strong> with <strong>24,962 points</strong></p><br><p>The winning teams are awarded a special title called \"WWCD\" (likely stands for \"Winner Winner Chicken Dinner\"). The title will appear next to the users' names in the chatrooms until the end of the next TSR. The users with the title appear to be slightly more respected in the tgochi.exe community. Winning a TSR also completes the \"True Supporter\" achievement.<br/>\nIn the announcement that revealed TSRs, the Developers explain that TSRs were created because they wanted to expand the game's servers' capacity but were \"severely limited by the available hardware\", so TSRs were \"the best solution to not only provide them with shiny new hardware, but also provide new exciting content to their players\".<br/>\nThe Developers also claimed that if the players made sure the next few TSRs would be a resounding success, then the game would be receiving its first major update, which would include new features such as \"a guild system, an in-game shop for supplies and a complete graphics overhaul with full-color screens and chatroom avatars as well as an original soundtrack\".<br/>\nWhat follows is the single screenshot the Developers themselves leaked.</p><br><p>The Developers stated one of the new features would be the background of the screens changing depending on which Level the players are currently in. This screenshot appears to have been taken in Level 0.</p><br><p>So far all TSRs have been extremely successful and rumor has it that the best performing players received \"tgochi.exe merch\" as a reward for their skill.</p><br><p>As tgochi.exe is a purely virtual entity, it has no proper biology. The coding language in which it is programmed is unknown and it seems capable of communication with the tgochi.exe servers even in the absence of an internet connection. How this is possible is unknown, but the <a href=\"/the-m-e-g\">M.E.G.</a> is currently studying the software in order to understand it. If such technology could be reproduced we'd be in possession of a way to communicate with each other with no need for internet connections.<br/>\nNot much is known about tgochi.exe's Developers, other than the fact that there are five of them and they appear to be three males and two females. There's no way to accertain whether they are human or not, but supernatural feats such as the way they collect the electronic supplies the players gather at the end of every TSR seem to suggest they aren't. The only way they communicate with the rest of the Backrooms is via the Announcements section of tgochi.exe and allegedly through mysterious cards that come with the rumored \"merch\".<br/>\nSome people speculate they're entities trying to lure players to their deaths, others think they're godlike beings who use tgochi.exe as a way of entertaining themselves, another popular hypothesis claims they're a group of sadistic hackers who noclipped into the Backrooms and found ways to hack reality itself. So far there is no proof to back any of these claims and their identity remains unknown.<br/>\nThe <a href=\"/the-m-e-g\">M.E.G.</a> is currently making an effort to seek them out and reveal their identity, but so far the investigation has been fruitless.</p><br><p>Similarly to how games spread in <a href=\"/the-frontrooms\">the Frontrooms</a>, tgochi.exe was first documented in early 2019, but it quickly spread through word of mouth among Wanderers in search of a thrill. Since then the playerbase has been growing exponentially and, as a consequence, <a href=\"/the-completionists\">The Completionists</a>' ranks have been growing ever since.</p><br><p><span class=\"printuser\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/nukboi\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7365837); return false;\">Nukboi</a></span></p><br><p><span class=\"printuser\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/nukboi\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7365837); return false;\">Nukboi</a></span></p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/entity-106\">Entity 106</a>\" by Nukboi, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

    "description": "<p><strong>Oxids</strong> are small, bronze-colored arthropods native to <a href=\"/level-61\">Level 61</a>, although they have been sighted on other levels. Eyewitnesses have compared them to crabs, albeit thinner and with large mandibles.</p><br><p><strong>Oxids</strong> scurry around various levels, searching for objects made out of base metals, such as copper or iron. Once an <strong>Oxid</strong> finds such an object, it will use its acidic \"saliva\" to corrode the metal for easier consumption. These rusted metals compose its entire diet.<br/>\n<strong>Oxids</strong> are naturally curious entities, and will search any bags or containers for something to eat. Tupperware is recommended as a way to keep them out of your belongings, as plastic does not oxidize.<br/>\n<a href=\"/level-61\">Level 61</a> is home to multiple <strong>Oxid</strong> colonies. These are nests made in the seating of The Old Train, occupied by as few as 10 and as many as 50 <strong>Oxids.</strong> Colonies usually have some sort of food stash, a hoard of leftover metal in case of emergencies. There is also a fungus known as Aecium in the center of the nest, which is what spawns new <strong>Oxids</strong>.

    "description": "<p><strong>The Birds</strong> are a murmuration of small, bird-like entities that hunt in groups.</p><br><p><strong>The Birds</strong> migrate frequently, never remaining in one Level. These entities blend into their environment by mimicking the appearance of objects as a hunting technique to avoid being spotted by their prey.</p><br><p><strong>The Birds</strong> remain hidden and do not react until they're approached. When an individual gets within fifteen feet of them, they will begin to make a shrill noise that, when heard, will induce a hypnotic-like state, in which an individual cannot move their body on their own and will involuntarily approach where <strong>The Birds</strong> are hidden. The hypnotic-like state has been reported to induce auditory hallucinations (see Interview Logs 12/05/2020 - 2).</p><br><p>When an individual is lured into the colony, <strong>The Birds</strong> will start to latch onto the body and proceed to eat away at the skin, only stopping when it reaches the bone. The best course of action when put into the aforementioned hypnotic-like state by this entity is to shine any available light onto <strong>The Birds</strong> as it has been observed to temporarily blind the entity.</p><br><p><strong>The Birds</strong> are 5-7 inches in length and resemble crudely drawn birds that are bright blue in appearance. Further observation shows that light passes through the bodies of <strong>The Birds</strong>. With how light affects <strong>The Birds</strong> it is possible that the entities' sensory parts form most of their bodies .<strong>The Birds</strong> can also feed on skin despite the lack of a visible mouth.</p><br><p>The first photographed evidence of <strong>The Birds</strong> was taken by Elijah Makaraig and Narda Makaraig in November of 2020, after an encounter with the entity.</p><br><p>The following are two interviews between a M.E.G officer (who has asked to remain anonymous), and the Makaraig siblings.</p><br><p><strong>Begin Log-1: 18:40</strong><br/>\n<strong>Interviewer:</strong> M.E.G. officer<br/>\n<strong>Interviewee:</strong> Narda Makaraig</p><br><p><strong>M.E.G. officer:</strong> Please state your name for the interview.</p><br><p><strong>N. Makaraig:</strong> My name is Narda Makaraig! Did you see the picture I took?</p><br><p><strong>M.E.G. officer:</strong> Yes. Thanks to you and your brother, other people will be safer now.</p><br><p><strong>N. Makaraig:</strong> Is he ok right now? He looked pretty hurt when I found him. He had this really gross wound on his arm.</p><br><p><strong>M.E.G. officer:</strong> Your brother is hurt, but he's being taken care of. If you don't mind can you answer a few questions?</p><br><p><strong>M.E.G. officer:</strong> Can you describe your encounter with the entity?</p><br><p><strong>N. Makaraig:</strong> The birds? Well all I remember is that Elijah suddenly disappeared and I heard this.. weird sound?</p><br><p><strong>M.E.G. officer:</strong> Oh? Um- can you describe the sound for me?</p><br><p><strong>N. Makaraig:</strong> It was- hm\u2026 It sounded pretty high, but, like quiet? Imagine screaming under your breath.</p><br><p><strong>M.E.G. officer:</strong> Ah- I see then. So you actually heard the birds? Did you start walking on your own?</p><br><p><strong>N.Makaraig:</strong> No? Not really. It was super loud though. I kinda thought that maybe it would start to get other creepy, weird things to start attacking us.</p><br><p><strong>M.E.G. officer:</strong> You didn't? That's probably from the distance\u2026 Well uh- what about when you got closer, did you start moving on your own then?</p><br><p><strong>N. Makaraig:</strong> Nope. They were still making the sound but it looked like Elijah was the one super freaked out about it. I saw him waving the flare around and thought that maybe it scared the birds away, that's why I got a blurry pic of them.</p><br><p><strong>M.E.G. officer:</strong> I see. Well thank you for your time Narda. I'll go talk to your brother next when he wakes up.</p><br><p><strong>N. Makaraig:</strong> Oh yeah here's a drawing I made of what happened. Pictures are needed in these things right? So yeah!<br/>\n<br/>\n[Narda then hands the Interviewer a drawing depicting what she had witnessed]</p><br><p><strong>NOTE: It would seem like the noise the birds make don't really affect anyone outside that 15 meter radius. It's also possible that the birds can only focus on one target at a time, it would explain why they need to isolate their prey. Further research on encounters with the birds should be done to see if this is a consistent thing.</strong></p><br><p><strong>End Log: 19: 05</strong></p><br><p><strong>Begin Log-2: 19:30</strong><br/>\n<strong>Interviewer:</strong> M.E.G. officer<br/>\n<strong>Interviewee:</strong> Elijah Makaraig</p><br><p><strong>M.E.G. officer:</strong> Please state your name for the interview.</p><br><p><strong>E. Makaraig:</strong> Elijah Makaraig- well I really want to get straight to the point.</p><br><p><strong>M.E.G. officer:</strong> Go ahead then.</p><br><p><strong>E. Makaraig:</strong> This isn't the first time I've heard of freaky ass birds attacking and eating people. When I heard they were blue I assumed it was that macaw with the creepy cult, but it wasn't.</p><br><p><strong>M.E.G. officer:</strong> Prior to the documentation of the entity, had you heard of anything about the birds?</p><br><p><strong>E. Makaraig:</strong> Just some rumors about your people finding fresh human bones in random levels.</p><br><p><strong>M.E.G. officer:</strong> Did you intend to personally investigate the existence of the entity?</p><br><p>[Elijah just stares at the M.E.G officer]</p><br><p><strong>E. Makaraig:</strong> What? No- Ugh- I can't do this.</p><br><p><strong>M.E.G. officer:</strong> Um excuse me?</p><br><p><strong>E. Makaraig:</strong> I was just saying shit out of my ass because I was afraid you were going to show this to Narda. I'd rather her not know anything, she only saw the end and took the photo you needed. That's all she should know.</p><br><p><strong>M.E.G. officer:</strong> Ignoring that you lied, can you please elaborate on that?</p><br><p><strong>E. Makaraig:</strong> I couldn't focus on the fact that the birds were biting down my arm. I couldn't feel it. I know you people will probably just write this down as a hallucination or an effect of the hypnosis but it didn't feel like it.</p><br><p><strong>M.E.G. officer:</strong> Can you elaborate on that further?</p><br><p><strong>E. Makaraig:</strong> I- uh- ugh.. [he sighs] I could only hear things. I heard the noise of the birds, but there was something under all that. It was muffled, as if I could hear it if I came closer. I came to only after I lit the road flare. Or well- I think I did. Narda scared off the rest of the birds with the camera flash.</p><br><p><strong>M.E.G. officer:</strong> Can you describe what exactly you heard?</p><br><p>[Both sat in silence for two minutes]</p><br><p><strong>E. Makaraig:</strong> I think- I think that you and your group should keep asking others what they think.</p><br><p><strong>M.E.G. officer:</strong> You said earlier that you believe what you were hearing was not a hallucination, can you please elaborate on that?</p><br><p><strong>E.

    "description": "<p>Entity 110, commonly known as Carnivorous Balloons, appear as balloons with a ribbon tied around their knot. They fill a sac inside their body with food and slowly let air out through their knot to make its smell waft through the floor, luring starving wanderers and entities to them. When prey is within their range, they'll attack with their venomous ribbon.<br/>\nCarnivorous Balloons prefer Levels with plenty of hiding spots or poor visibility, as it makes it easier for them to catch their prey by surprise.</p><br><p>Carnivorous Balloons are stationary predators, in a way similar to carnivorous plants. The food they store in their cavity (which usually contains high quantities of ingredients with a strong smell like onions or garlic) is never used as food from the entity, but only as a bait. From their observation it appears that they aren't interested in any kind of food that isn't raw meat that they themselves have hunted.<br/>\nOnce an unsuspecting wanderer touches the surface of a Balloon, the ribbon will tightly grip whatever limb touched it and inject a paralyzing toxin that will render the victim incapable of fighting back. As soon as its prey is successfully paralyzed, the Balloon will open the sphincter in its knot and let the food contained inside of its sac fall on the ground.<br/>\nIt will then \"bite\" the victim's limb with its opening and start to digest it. The digestion process is carried out with the use of gaseous ammonia, which is highly corrosive and digests the victim in a similar way to hydrochloric acid in the human stomach. The process can last a few days and the victim will be conscious and able to feel pain until they eventually die from blood loss, dehydration or buildup of toxic substances in their body.<br/>\nCarnivorous Balloons are solitary entities who are incapable of autonomous movement and rely on air currents to move through the floor they reside in. They are not only aggressive towards wanderers and other entities, but any object that moves inside of their range.<br/>\nIf a living being or an object is inside their range but refuses to touch them, they will start blindly flailing their ribbon, hoping to sting them.</p><br><p>Carnivorous Balloons can be of any shape, color and size (in fact, it's not infrequent to find some animal shaped specimens), however they all invariably have a ribbon. Multiple specimens have been dissected in recent times, so their anatomy is generally well understood. Although they appear to be made out of common rubber or latex, their external surface is actually thin contractile tissue. The interior consists of two sacs: one larger sac making up roughly 80% of a Balloon's volume containing the highly concentrated ammonia gas that Balloons use to digest their victims and a smaller sac making up roughly 20% of a Balloon's volume containing the food they use to lure their victims. Where the food comes from is currently unknown.<br/>\nThe ribbon is the most sensitive part of their body. It serves both as a sensory organ and as a stinging tentacle, with a structure nearly identical to that of jellyfish. It has an average length of 120\u00a0cm.<br/>\nCarnivorous Balloons typically have a lifespan of 6 to 8 weeks, after which their knot will loosen up and become incapable of keeping the ammonia gas inside them</p><br><p>It's impossible to accurately determine when this entity first appeared in the Backrooms, since experienced wanderers tend to steer clear of balloons because of <a href=\"/entity-67\">The Partygoers</a>, although, to our knowledge, <a href=\"/entity-67\">The Partygoers</a> are completely unrelated to this entity.<br/>\nThe first recorded encounter with a Carnivorous Balloon occurred in <a href=\"/level-8\">Level 8</a>. A member of <a href=\"/the-m-e-g\">the M.E.G.</a> Postal Division tasked with delivering supplies to <a href=\"/the-m-e-g\">the M.E.G.</a> Team \u201cCave Raiders\u201d failed to notice the presence of a Balloon due to the darkness of the level and accidentally touched it. While he did survive the balloon\u2019s attack thanks to the prompt reaction of his teammates, he still suffered severe chemical burns on his right hand and forearm as well as damage to the eyes that resulted in significant vision loss.</p><br><p><span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/nukboi\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7365837); return false;\"><img alt=\"Nukboi\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7365837&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1731442741\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7365837)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/nukboi\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7365837); return false;\">Nukboi</a></span></p><br><p>\"Red Balloons in the Middle of the Road\" by IQRemix is licensed with CC BY-SA 2.0.

    "title": "- \"Wraiths\"",
    "description": "<p>Captured image of a recently formed Wraith.</p><br><p><strong>Wraiths</strong> is the designation given to souls found in a state of perpetual unrest and cyclical revival. They are the remnants of beings whose access to an afterlife was restricted due to a highly sinful mortal existence. The guilt they carry from their past life and the rage exacerbated by the prospect of their current form does not allow them to dissipate, and so they return as vengeful spirits.</p><br><p>Given the precepts of our organization, <strong>Wraiths</strong> are often created by our own hand as we strike down the most vicious criminals. These <strong>Wraiths</strong> cannot be permanently banished from this realm, relegating them to eternal damnation. To prevent the creatures from ravaging the Labyrinth, the bodies of sinners whose sin exceeds the designated threshold of profanity must be transported to <a href=\"/the-profane-burial-site\">The Profane Burial Site</a> within <a href=\"/level-46-1\">The Monastery</a> for appropriate sepulture. In there, many rituals and procedures exist to ensure the weaker <strong>Wraiths</strong> lie within their tombs indefinitely. However, most will eventually resurface, which means they will need to be forcefully put to unrest in their graves for another cycle.</p><br><p>As incorporeal beings, <strong>Wraiths</strong> don\u2019t possess a proper physical aspect. Instead, they manifest a spiritual form that is anchored to our plane of existence by the weight of their sins, allowing them to interact with the living world.</p><br><p><strong>Wraiths</strong> initially appear as an unstable, spectral copy of their former physical form. Weaker <strong>Wraiths</strong>, and those rising for the first time, may have trouble maintaining a solid shape, appearing as a gaseous figure slightly reminiscent of their previous appearance. As they persist in this way of being, however, their physical presence will solidify, but will also potentially undergo significant alterations. The longer they exist in the living world without a body, the more wretched and malformed they become.</p><br><p>A <strong>Wraith</strong>'s continued existence in the improper realm causes them to lose their essence of self, generating rifts and cracks in their souls. Stripped of any remnants from their mortal life but their sins, they slowly become more influenced by them. Their spiritual structure is then forced to accept the malice within them as the only substance left to fill these gaps, with immediate, perceivable effects. The manifestation of the <strong>Wraith</strong> ultimately becomes predominantly comprised of its sins rather than its discarded flesh. This will happen naturally over time, but can be accelerated if the <strong>Wraith</strong> goes through multiple revival cycles.</p><br><p>Though it is not universal, the majority of <strong>Wraiths</strong> lose their intelligence and are relegated to a bestial existence when they first arise. Most notably, there is one renowned instance of a <strong>Wraith</strong> that retained all its faculties and managed to escape the confines of The Profane Burial Site. The Royal Remnant, otherwise known as <a href=\"/entity-33\">The King</a>, was one of the first foes to be beaten by the conjoined forces of our patron and the first <a href=\"/the-eyes-of-argos\">Eyes of Argos</a>. His remains were taken to The Profane Burial Site while it was still under construction because of the fear that his vast power would grant him a quick transformation into a <strong>Wraith</strong>. Exploiting this circumstance and the lack of preparation among the initial wardens of The Monastery, The Royal Remnant ordered his forces to attack it, which facilitated his escape.</p><br><p>All <strong>Wraiths</strong> seek one unique purpose, to consume the energy of the living in a vain attempt to regain their past form. The approach they take to achieve this depends entirely on their mental capacity. Some might guide themselves by pure instinct, while others are perfectly capable of carefully planning their prey's demise. The intelligence level of <strong>Wraiths</strong> varies widely, and is dependent on the strength of the creature's initial spiritual imprint at death. Factors that can affect this corporeal integrity include: the amount of accumulated sin that they carried at death, their fortitude of mind and body while alive, and the damage suffered by their soul when they perished.</p><br><p style=\"text-align: center;\">An account of the known, unrestrained <strong>Wraith</strong> activity.</p><br><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"blue\">IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED</span></p><br><p style=\"text-align: center;\">A highly sinful threat has been detected within Ground 1, and its exact position has been confirmed via our patron's True Vision.

    "description": "<p><strong>Entity 115</strong>, also known as the Artikeli /\"The Article People\" or \u201cCreated Ones\u201d, are an intelligent, anthropomorphic entity species, often nicknamed \"Junkers\" by human people. They take the outward appearance of everyday man-made objects, with cartoonish limbs and facial features. Possessing both a sizable population and cognitive capacities rivaling mankind\u2019s, they are one of the only species known to have established an independent, non-human civilization within the Backrooms.</p><br><p>Created Ones predominantly inhabit towns and cities within <a href=\"/level-321\">Level 321</a> (which they call \"the lands of art\") and <a href=\"/level-184\">Level 184</a>, with much smaller colonies noted on other levels. However, they appear to originate from <a href=\"/level-94\">Level 94</a>, known to them as \u201cthe lands of falsehood\u201d. The Artikeli claim to be descendants of the souls of humans and faeries<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> whose bodies were consumed by <a href=\"/entity-33\">its ruler</a>. However, the exact details of their species\u2019 inception are unclear, and remain shrouded in myth and legend.</p><br><p>While generally peaceful and polite, the Artikeli have a superstitious and insular culture, and tend to view outsiders with distrust. Nevertheless, their relations with mankind have steadily improved with half a century of various diplomatic efforts. Many communities today welcome human visitors, and some even contain significant resident human populations. Wanderers interacting with the Artikeli are strongly advised to respect their beliefs and practices, in order to maintain their tenuous positive impression of modern society.</p><br><p>Instances of entity 115 are generally about 4-5 feet (120-150cm) tall, varying wildly in weight between 40 and 140 pounds (18-64kg). They are quick on their feet, and possess the same strength as typical human beings. Their eyes are large, big black, shiny circles, and their mouths are usually a cartoonish line when closed. Their bodies usually resemble man-made objects of some kind, consisting of anything from playing cards to lightbulbs to medieval swords. Their limbs are black, with simple semicircular feet, and hands of five fingers which resemble black ellipsoids when balled into closed fists, but resemble human hands when open. Artikeli may occasionally grow hair \u2014 the trait is genetically possible, though rare, and women are known to sport stereotypically large cartoon eyelashes.</p><br><p>Offspring of the Created Ones exhibit characteristics of both the mother and father, meaning they reproduce sexually. How this happens is still unclear.</p><br><p>With human-level intellect and complex societal structures, the Created Ones have developed an advanced civilization bearing distinct socio-behavioral features. Their unique religion, known as Pietism, is conservative and monotheistic, with strong emphases on tradition, family, honor, and morality. Additionally, their culture is heavily superstitious, and their social psyche has been strongly shaped by historic myths as well as urban legend. This has resulted in communities of a rather insular and exclusive nature -\u2013 Artikeli tend to remain within the stable social confines of their families and immediate communities, and almost never leave to associate with outsiders. As a whole, Artikeli society has historically expressed distrust of outside influences, and particular suspicion toward large organizations of other intelligent species.</p><br><p>Fortunately, this characteristic disdain for external organizations has been on a decline in recent years. Over years of interaction and trade, the species\u2019 cultural sentiment toward mankind has warmed considerably. Many features of modern human society have made their way into Artikeli culture, and individuals have become much more open to social contact and relations with human beings. In inter-species engagements, individuals tend to be polite and reserved, while also exhibiting noticeable curiosity toward differences in culture.</p><br><p>In spite of these inroads, many circles continue to retain mistrustful or condescending attitudes toward human society. This is evident, for example, in the common use of the derogatory term \u201cLankies\u201d to refer to humans, and the lingering stereotype of humans as \u201cbandits and raiders\u201d.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup> Interestingly, human circles within Artikeli society appear to have developed their own stereotypes in response. Use of the term \u201cJunkers\u201d to refer to Created Ones has become popular in recent years.</p><br><p>In its extant form, Artikeli civilization is concentrated within two key nation-states. The unique characteristics of each one are further described below.</p><br><p><a href=\"/level-321\">Level 321</a> \u2014</p><br><p>Ah, the Regency. Home of nobility, culture, extravagance, honor\u2026 and of course, the traditionalist quacks who still hope this country will ever really become a monarchy.<br/>\n\u2014 Operative Pratt Grimm</p><br><p><br/></p><br><p>A recreation of the flag of the Regency, displaying the Broken Sun and Moon in its seal.</p><br><p>The Regent Commonwealth of Artland is the heart of Artikeli civilization. With a land area of approximately 4 million km<sup>2</sup> (1.5 million square miles) within <a href=\"/level-321\">Level 321</a> (known to the Artikeli as \u201cthe lands of Art\u201d), it houses the vast majority of Created Ones live here, with a population of approximately around six million of them. Towns and cities are dotted across the level\u2019s various floors, though they are primarily concentrated around Jarlford, its densely-populated capital. It's citizens generally prefer to refer to the Regent Commonweath as the Commonwealth, but for the sake of professionalism, it will be called the Regency in this article.</p><br><p>The Regency possesses significant linguistic diversity. Created Ones in the state are known to speak all manner of languages, including Norwegian, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Greek, Romani, French, and even Latin. However, English remains the <em>lingua franca</em> \u2013 and even more so in recent decades, as exposure to the M.E.G. and other human influences continues to drive homogenization and centralization in the state.</p><br><p>Culturally, citizens of the Regency tend to be more tightly knit and insular than their counterparts in the Artland colonies (though just as family-oriented). Social structure tends to be traditionally patriarchal, and members are usually expected to abide by rigid societal norms and roles. Though this may appear oppressive by modern standards, most Created Ones express contentment with their way of life, finding comfort in the familiar orders and routines of their daily lives.</p><br><p>In spite of the social order, however, traditional legends of the Regency are fantastical and grandiose, speaking of amazing explorers and valiant warriors in the Artikeli\u2019s past. Built on the culture\u2019s rich mythic history and religious iconography, the state possesses an artistic scene which continues to flourish today. Visual, musical, literary, and dramatic arts are valued highly in Artikeli culture, and regional communities each boast unique artistic circles with distinctive styles. Artists by profession are known to be especially superstitious \u2013 often to an absurd degree, even according to Artikeli standards. For example, many Artikeli artists claim to have faerie ancestry, with very little basis. In spite of such idiosyncrasies, artists are recognized in the quasi-religious annual holiday often known as \"The Half Full Festival\". Celebrated on March 22nd, the holiday aims to uphold both social harmony and virtue as pillars of Artikeli society and heritage. Through feasting and artistic showcases, it honors the Regency\u2019s rich religious and cultural background, as well as its contingent artistic innovations. The holiday is celebrated not only in the Regency, but also in other Artikeli colonies \u2013 as are a majority of its various festivals.</p><br><p>Moreover, as its name suggests, the Regency is a constitutional elective monarchy, governed by a council with an elected king who serves a five year term in the absence of true royalty, the current ruler is King Roderic Oldenburg. According to Artikeli legend, the state was founded by an individual known as Hargan of Germania, alongside the conception of the Artikeli people, following a climactic battle against the <a href=\"/entity-33\">Evil King</a> of <a href=\"/level-94\">Level 94</a>, traditionally known as \u201cthe land of falsehood\u201d. Hargan is said to have uttered a prophecy, preserved within Pietist texts, predicting the birth of a young man and young woman in the far future, known as the Broken Sun and Broken Moon. The prophecy claims that the pair will save the Regency from almost certain destruction in its darkest times, and be crowned its rightful royal family.</p><br><p>The founding legend of the Regency is celebrated annually in another festival \u2014 the Festival of The Broken Sun and The Broken Moon. Lasting from June 22nd to June 29th, the week-long holiday is known for its lavish celebrations, replete with religious services, family reunions, gift-giving, spontaneous dance parties, and copious quantities of alcohol consumed. This is widely regarded as the most rowdy time of the year, infamous for its large crowds throughout the capital halls and even non-Artikeli tourists visiting the Regency.</p><br><p>Notably, there is a myth among humans that have only heard of Level 321 claiming it allows Artikeli to survive indefinitely without eating or drinking and that that is why exile is viewed as tantamount to death by the population. In truth, the citizenry simply live as long as they do here because the risk of infections is lower within an indoor level and they maintain the cleanliness of the parts of the level within their borders, helping to lower the risk much further, in addition to weakening the need for food within their borders even further than the level alone would, letting them live much longer on average and store much more food more quickly.<br/>\nHowever, it is accepted by most citizens that the quasi-historical figure, Hargan of Germania, still lives in a remote region of the nation. Government officials are often noted to send him letters, as he is alleged to be willing to answer them. However, the Regency refuses to disclose his direct location, as he allegedly desires to never be sought out directly, and is said to only come to Jarlford when he pleases, which makes this famous myth so easy to fall for for humans and citizens of the next state covered in this article.</p><br><p><a href=\"/level-184\">Level 184</a> \u2014</p><br><p>This is where I grew up. The Dominion is somehow both the most and the <em>least</em> modern branch of Artikeli society. It's like what the Meg calls \u201cAustralia\u201d in their world. A couple hundred years ago, some colonial government prick found this backwater farm-world, and thought it would be the perfect for the Regency to send its criminals and pesky political dissidents\u2026 mainly those who want to just accept the title of republic. Throw in a truckload of Purist missionaries into the mix, and lo and behold \u2013 up comes the Dominion from the soggy dirt. When my human friend Jack visited, he made a remark that basically sums the place up:<br/>\n\u201cIt\u2019s like one of those ugly, happy little farming towns in Ohio.\u201d<br/>\nNo place like home, I guess.<br/>\n\u2013 Operative Pratt Grimm</p><br><p>The Dominion of New Artland is a large series of.colonies of the Regency in <a href=\"/level-184\">Level 184</a>. Around 12,800 Created Ones live in New Artland's capital, New Sodbury. The rural towns and villages house an additional registered 12,000 citizens, however many colonists have been said to go off and start their own towns and registering them with the Dominion government over the decades, giving the Dominion a total population population of around 200,000.</p><br><p>In contrast to the semi-urbanized and indoor Regency, the Dominion is characterized by its rugged agrarian culture. Without the protective semi-invulnerability offered by Level 321, the colony historically suffered child mortality rates due to disease and starvation from its founding in 1600 until the early 1900s. These were alleviated, first by the introduction of the potato as a staple crop, and then by the rapid progression of industry, education, and technology in the modern era -\u2013 owing in large part to human trade and influence. Accordingly, humans are generally more welcome in the Dominion than in the Regency heartland, with human inhabitants making up an estimated 13% of the population. Despite leaps in its standard of living, infrastructural issues continue to plague New Artland, with its plumbing system and electric grid being only semi-functional.</p><br><p>Socially, the Dominion more closely resembles modern Western human society, with a much higher degree of expressive freedom, social flux, and cultural diversity than the Regency. This is likely the result of their colonial background. As a combination of haggard religious Purists and skilled peasant craftsmen, early settlers likely cultivated the adaptability, hardiness, and stoic discipline which persist as key cultural values in New Artland today.</p><br><p>In spite of its sociocultural advances, the political climate of New Artland is significantly less stable than the Regency\u2019s. From the Dominion\u2019s inception, there has been continuous strife between culturally conservative Purist circles and more liberal communities desiring freedom from the vestiges of the Regency\u2019s social order. Following disastrous attempts at self-governance, with years of civil rebellion and bloodshed, an uneasy but successful social contract was established in 1876, with the colony looking to the Regency as a neutral arbiter for governance. This has cultivated a strong sense of political and societal loyalty to the Regency within the Dominion today, in spite of their significant sociocultural differences.</p><br><p>While the Artikeli have been recognized for many years, formal M.E.G. contact with their civilization was established in 2015, with the help of an M.E.G. operative of their species, Pratt Grimm. Along with his partner, Operative Jack Forrest, Grimm returned to his hometown in <a href=\"/level-184\">Level 184</a>, followed by a trip to the capital of the Dominion, New Sodbury. Full documentation of the expedition is available on the <a href=\"/the-m-e-g\">M.E.G. archive</a>, and is strongly recommended as a resource for individuals seeking to integrate into Artikeli society.</p><br><p>While passing through Grimm's hometown, the operatives also encountered his childhood friend, Mr. Fred Mann, and managed to secure an interview, providing valuable insight on Artkeli life and culture in Level 184.</p><br><p><strong>Location:</strong> Dominion of New Artland (Level 184)<br/>\n<strong>Personnel:</strong> Operative Jack Forrest, Operative Pratt Grimm</p><br><p><strong>Description:</strong> In collecting data for this article, operatives Grimm and Forrest visited Grimm\u2019s hometown in New Artland. The following is a transcript of an interview with Grimm\u2019s childhood friend, Fred Mann.</p><br><p><strong>Jack:</strong> This is\u2026 quite something.</p><br><p><tt>The camera pans around a sea of grain, the golden fields rippling gently in the mid-day breeze. In the distance, a tractor whirrs along, the sound of its merry sputtering echoing out across the plains.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Pratt:</strong> Told you it was primitive.</p><br><p><strong>Jack:</strong> It\u2019s certainly\u2026 rustic. I\u2019ve never seen so much wheat in my life!</p><br><p><strong>Pratt:</strong> And I never thought I\u2019d be back here. Not so soon, anyway.</p><br><p><tt>The pair close in on a figure leaning against a fence. As they draw nearer, the Created One\u2019s short, oblong figure comes into focus as a playing card. He is clothed in a set of blue farming overalls caked in fresh earth. The brilliant, vermillion hue of the ace of spades symbol stands out on the upper left corner of his rectangular face.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Hey Pratt? Anything I should know before I interact with your uh\u2026</p><br><p><strong>Pratt:</strong> My people? Yeah \u2013 don\u2019t be a jackass. Simple as that.</p><br><p><tt>Upon their approach, the Artikeli\u2019s eyes widen in astonishment.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Pratt:</strong> Hey, Fred.</p><br><p><strong>Fred:</strong> <em>Oh</em>\u2026 hey Pratt. <em>(A long pause.)</em> Uh\u2026 long time no see?</p><br><p><strong>Jack:</strong> I assume this was the friend you were telling me about?</p><br><p><strong>Pratt:</strong> Yep. Fred, this is Jack.</p><br><p><strong>Fred:</strong> Uhhhh\u2026 hi\u2026?</p><br><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Nice to meet you!</p><br><p><tt>Jack extends a hand.</tt></p><br><p><tt>Fred eyes him warily for a few moments, before reaching his own hand forward to shake.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Alright, so to explain \u2013 your friend Pratt and I are working with a human organization called the Major Explorer Group (M.E.G. for short).</p><br><p><strong>Fred:</strong> Uh\u2026 yeah. Pratt did tell us he was going to join you guys\u2026 just before he left.</p><br><p><strong>Jack:</strong> We were just stopping by to document a bit about your society. Could you spare a moment for an interview? Hope you\u2019re not too busy with your farm work and all\u2026</p><br><p><strong>Fred:</strong> Gosh, well I\u2026 I suppose I can\u2019t refuse, now, can I? You\u2019ve come all the way down here.</p><br><p><strong>Pratt:</strong> Thanks, Fred. My pal here\u2019s the one who\u2019s nuts about this place for some reason, so I\u2019ll let him take over for now. We can catch up after if you like.</p><br><p><tt>Jack trades the camera into Pratt\u2019s hands, and steps forward eagerly with his notepad.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Alright, so Mr. Fred\u2026</p><br><p><strong>Fred:</strong> Mann. M-A-N-N.</p><br><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Mmhmm. Alright, well, obviously, we know a bit about this place from Pratt already, but it\u2019s been a while since he\u2019s been here. What's changed since Pratt left the Dominion?</p><br><p><strong>Fred:</strong> Not much. After he left, people were kind of worried that he was\u2026 <em>dead</em>, to put it bluntly. It\u2019s still\u2026 a bit of a shock to see him here. Don\u2019t misunderstand me, I'm glad he\u2019s alive and well, but I'm also\u2026 concerned.</p><br><p><tt>Fred turns toward Pratt.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Fred:</strong> What <em>exactly</em> was it that got into you anyway? What made you go all the way out there to be with the Lankies?</p><br><p><tt>Pratt shrugs indifferently.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Pratt:</strong> I wanted something new. Just to go and see and do new things. Plus, I don't exactly have the right attitude to sell my dad's farm tools to normal people. My brothers are way more social and suited for the job.</p><br><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Well, there's your answer. Next question: is there anything the M.E.G. should know about New Sodbury?</p><br><p><strong>Fred:</strong> I\u2019m uh\u2026 not very sure\u2026 how to answer that? It depends on what it is that you lot want from us, really\u2026</p><br><p><tt>As he ponders the question, a sudden frown comes upon Fred\u2019s face, and he places his hands on his hips. His eyes narrow in suspicion.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Fred:</strong> Now hold on\u2026 you\u2019re not here to <em>spy</em> on us, are you? We\u2019ve had our fair share of bandit Lankies mooching off of our stuff since New Sod started opening the gates.</p><br><p><strong>Jack:</strong> What? Oh of course not-</p><br><p><strong>Fred:</strong> You know, this is all a bit fishy if you ask me\u2026 Pratt coming back here all of a sudden, outta nowhere-</p><br><p><strong>Pratt:</strong> <em>(In annoyance)</em> Oh, don\u2019t be an <em>idiot</em>, Fred. What\u2019s there even to rob in this old cesspool?</p><br><p><strong>Fred:</strong> How should I know? Grain ain\u2019t cheap-</p><br><p><strong>Pratt:</strong> If we wanted that, we\u2019d have gone straight to the Regency snobs. They\u2019re the ones who hoard it\u2026 since they literally <em>don\u2019t need to eat</em>.</p><br><p><strong>Fred:</strong> Heh, well\u2026 you\u2019re damned right about that.</p><br><p><tt>Fred nods in approval at the jab towards the Dominion\u2019s rulers. He relaxes considerably.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Sorry, you mentioned something about the city \u2018opening the gates\u2019? Could you tell us more about that?</p><br><p><strong>Fred:</strong> Oh, yeah. It was a pretty big policy change not long ago\u2026 Lankies like you have been welcome in the country for a long time now, but it\u2019s only recently that the city\u2019s been opening up to let humans stay as residents.</p><br><p><strong>Jack:</strong> That\u2019s interesting. How do you find the change?</p><br><p><strong>Fred:</strong> It\u2019s pretty controversial, if you ask me. Isn\u2019t the best for the crime rate\u2026 lots of unsavory folks are taking the chance to flood in.</p><br><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Really? <em>(Amused)</em> Surely we \u2018Lankies\u2019 aren\u2019t <em>that</em> bad?</p><br><p><strong>Fred:</strong> If you\u2019re wondering, my aunt Kathy was actually mugged by a couple of you humans just last Tuesday.</p><br><p><strong>Jack:</strong> \u2026 Oh.</p><br><p><strong>Fred:</strong> One of \u2018em had a knife. Stuck her in the shoulder like this \u2013 <em>(he gestures, quite vigorously)</em> \u2013 and snatched her wallet right out of her hand.</p><br><p><tt>There is a hint of bitterness in Fred\u2019s tone. Jack grimaces, fixing his eyes downward upon his notepad rather deliberately.</tt></p><br><p><tt>A somewhat awkward silence follows, lasting about half a minute.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Pratt:</strong> That certainly sounds rough. Is she alright, Fred?</p><br><p><strong>Fred:</strong> Well, she\u2026 won\u2019t be out of the hospital for another week, I suppose.</p><br><p><tt>He folds his arms, leaning back against the fence.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Jack:</strong> I\u2019m\u2026 sorry to hear that.</p><br><p><strong>Fred:</strong> It\u2019s fine. Not like you did it. And really, others have had it worse.</p><br><p><tt>Another pause.</tt></p><br><p><tt>Somewhere high above, a lone passing cloud drifts across the sky. Its shadow meanders slowly across the fields.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Fred:</strong> It\u2019s pretty obvious to us that it\u2019s unfair to judge people based on where they come from. And when it comes to humans, you \u2018Meg\u2019 lot are certainly decent enough, as far as I\u2019ve heard. But even then\u2026</p><br><p><tt>Fred pauses, gazing upward.</tt></p><br><p><tt>The cloud passes directly overhead, blanketing the trio in a patch of shade for a moment.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Fred:</strong> \u2026 even then, there\u2019s a reason why it\u2019s not easy for us to trust you Lankies. There\u2019s always a couple bad eggs in the bunch.</p><br><p><tt>The cloud passes, and the rays of sunlight return, illuminating the rippling golden landscape.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Fred:</strong> So yeah, that\u2019s why we\u2019re a little worried about the whole \u201copening up\u201d thing. Not much we can do about it though\u2026 the Regency\u2019s governor-general insisted on it.</p><br><p><tt>The expression on Fred\u2019s face lightens considerably.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Fred:</strong> At least business is boomin\u2019. For all our gripes you Lankies really have a way with machines\u2026 crop yields have doubled in some parts thanks to your new-fangled gear.</p><br><p><strong>Jack:</strong> <em>(Nods approvingly)</em> We\u2019ve had a look around on our way here. Your farms are quite a sight\u2026 especially for people used to the indoors, like me.</p><br><p><strong>Fred:</strong> My turn to ask a question, then. Pratt here obviously thinks we\u2019re a backwater dump\u2026 but what do you lot think of the Dominion?</p><br><p><strong>Jack:</strong> It's doing great, from what I can tell! I was just telling Pratt on the way here\u2026 it's like one of those ugly, happy little farming towns in Ohio-</p><br><p><strong>Pratt:</strong> <em>(In horror)</em> JACK! I told you <em>not</em> to say that!</p><br><p><tt>It takes a moment for Jack to notice his mistake. His eyes widen.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Oh, dude, I'm sorry, I didn\u2019t mean-</p><br><p><strong>Pratt:</strong> You had <em>one</em> job, Jack! You could have said <em>anything</em> but that, and you said it out loud! What the hell were you thinking-</p><br><p><strong>Fred:</strong> <em>(Blankly)</em> What\u2019s an \u2018Ohio\u2019?</p><br><p><tt>Jack and Pratt pause abruptly in their bickering.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Pratt:</strong> Well\u2026 it isn\u2019t very flattering, obviously.</p><br><p><strong>Fred:</strong> Eh, it\u2019s alright Pratt, I know he didn't mean it like that.</p><br><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Yeah, I\u2019m sorry, man, I-</p><br><p><strong>Fred:</strong> Relax, it happens. <em>(He shrugs.)</em> We all let our manners slip sometimes. What were you going to ask me next?</p><br><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Uhh\u2026 right. <em>(Jack ruffles through his notepad.)</em> This is\u2026 probably the last question\u2026 do you think the M.E.G. would be allowed to recruit members from your population?</p><br><p><strong>Fred:</strong> Hmph\u2026 so you guys <em>do</em> have a motive for being here. Recruitment, eh? Beats me. You\u2019d have to ask the governor up in New Sod.</p><br><p><strong>Jack:</strong> And how\u2019d you think that would go, personally?</p><br><p><strong>Fred:</strong> I assume you\u2019d get permission\u2026 though that\u2019s really only because nobody would take you that seriously. I mean\u2026 you\u2019ve heard about our issues with opening up the city. I doubt you\u2019d find anyone who\u2019d want to join your 'Meg' at all.</p><br><p><strong>Jack:</strong> What about Pratt here, though?</p><br><p><tt>Fred rolls his eyes.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Fred</strong> Meh\u2026 Pratt's\u2026 kind of a 'lightning in a bottle' case. It\u2019s weird because he's just\u2026 very, very individualistic.</p><br><p><strong>Pratt:</strong> <em>(Approvingly)</em> That\u2019s certainly true.</p><br><p><strong>Fred:</strong> The most others like him have done is to just go out and start their own farms or towns. He's really one of a kind. I don\u2019t know anyone else who\u2019s ventured out of Artikeli domains. You were lucky to get him at all.</p><br><p><strong>Pratt:</strong> Heh, I\u2019m flattered.</p><br><p><strong>Fred:</strong> Not great for your recruitment, though. They don't like taking risks the same way he does.</p><br><p><strong>Pratt:</strong> I certainly doubt it\u2019ll catch on. Not much has changed since I left, clearly\u2026 nobody around here really trusts the M.E.G., still.</p><br><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Interesting. Maybe we\u2019ll have more luck with the Regency.</p><br><p><strong>Pratt:</strong> I doubt that. Though maybe with their superstitions, there\u2019s a chance they\u2019ll be interested.</p><br><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Well, I think that\u2019s it for now. Thanks for your time, Fred.</p><br><p><strong>Fred:</strong> Of course. Although, seeing as that\u2019s out of the way\u2026</p><br><p><tt>Fred turns to his old friend once more, curiosity in his eyes.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Fred:</strong> Maybe it\u2019s your turn for a little \u2018interview\u2019.

    "description": "<p>Entity 116, also known as \"Dentists\", are humanoid entities that resemble a melted or mutilated form of a human. Entity 116 instances are composed of mass amounts of human teeth, gums, and jaws taken from their victims. Before Entity 116 instances acquire any victims, they are hypothesized to have a similar appearance to a human without its skin. Instances are lacking in sapience and tend to run or walk into walls and objects frequently, as well as fall over due to the lack of movement limited by their teeth. Behind them, they leave a trail of saliva and phlegm, as well as a pungent stench similar to a decomposing human carcass. It is unknown how many instances of Entity 116 there are, although it has been speculated that they asexually reproduce inside <a href=\"/level-64\">Level 64</a>.</p><br><p>Entity 116 instances are extremely hostile entities that begin to hobble towards a wanderer as soon as they are noticed. In the event of Entity 116 catching a victim, they will tackle or pin them down, and begin taking the victim's teeth and gums while attaching the said teeth and gums to themselves.</p><br><p>Entity 116 kills its victims by:</p><br><p>Dentists usually act lethargic and slow but gain a large burst of energy and strength that acts when hunting a victim. It is unknown if this acts as a form of adrenaline, or if they purposely save their energy to be at peak level for hunting.</p><br><p>One of two ways to identify Entity 116 is through the sounds of shuffling movement, squishing and squelching, scraping, and/or clicking. The other way to identify them is through the pungent scent of dead bodies they produce. If the scent of dead bodies suddenly becomes extremely overpowering, it is likely a Dentist is near. This odor can be smelt from a considerable distance and lingers for a while \u2014 especially on clothes. Most treat this smell as a warning system for approaching Entity 116 instances.</p><br><p>Entity 116 is composed of an amalgamation of teeth, gums, and jaws from previous victims. The gums have been noted to always be decomposing and have multiple gum diseases and mold growing on them. Along with this, instances often secrete phlegm and a slimy mucus-like substance.</p><br><p>This mucus seeps through the teeth, giving Entity 116 an oily texture. Despite this, the entity seems to have very little trouble removing teeth from its victims. It has been observed that victims of Entity 116 who have their teeth touched by this mucus had been infected with an unknown strand of oral disease. This disease causes severe symptoms of Gingivitis and tooth decay. This disease will later spread to the victim's sinuses, causing irritation and deterioration of the throat and nose. All diagnosed cases of this disease have ended in death or permanent side effects.</p><br><p>The decaying state of the teeth and jaws in/on Entity 116 limits its range of movement significantly while chasing a wanderer, which causes it to be slow and appear injured. Entity 116 instances tend to ignore this issue and continue to attach teeth, gums, etc. to themselves. It is presumed they do this due to the fragility of their bodies, and they use the teeth and gums as armor.</p><br><p>It was originally thought that the human gums were their actual form, but after an attack,<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> a chunk of its armor was knocked off, displaying some sort of skin-like material. After this incident, the <a href=\"/the-m-e-g\">M.E.G.</a> explorers present on the scene collected samples of this material for testing, and eventually found human DNA, some of which matched certain missing individuals. There is an unofficial theory that these entities may be the result of a failed <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/the-splinter\">Splinter</a> experiment, but this is nothing more than whispers.</p><br><p>Entity 116 has been identified to be human. The skin of Entity 116 has been branded with a pentagram with strange symbols. This is the same logo as The Church of the Veiled.</p><br><p>Entity 116 instances have a hole resembling some sort of mouth towards the top of its body, but it appears to not use the hole for anything other than breathing. They do have human-like orifices such as earholes, sweat glands, and a hole for the excretion of bodily fluids.</p><br><p>Entity 116's earholes are extremely sensitive, and are able to pick noise from about 3,000 to 20,000\u00a0Hz, and can even hear noise from as far as 1.5 miles away \u2014 although this can vary. This sense has been heightened due to Entity 116's blindness.</p><br><p>Photograph after a survivor got away from an Entity 116 attack.</p><br><p>Entity 116 was first discovered when <a href=\"/the-m-e-g\">M.E.G.</a> explorers were exploring <a href=\"/level-33\">Level 33</a>, when they saw a humanoid entity made up of teeth attack a wanderer. They quickly killed the entity via a crossbow arrow. It took about 14 arrows to do any lethal damage to do the teeth, which were surprisingly durable. They later inspected her and noticed that three teeth were missing. The Entity 116 instance had her teeth in its hand, which was later disposed of along with the body. This was documented when similar incidents occurred soon after with multiple other wanderers.</p><br><p><span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/s-n-o-w-y\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6723882); return false;\"><img alt=\"s n o w y\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=6723882&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334071\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=6723882)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/s-n-o-w-y\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6723882); return false;\">s n o w y</a></span></p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/entity-115\">Entity 115</a> | Entity 116 | <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/entity-117\">Entity 117</a> \u00bb</p><br>",

    "description": "<p><tt>I don't know if the entity template was the correct choice, but regardless, I need to get this information out quickly. There seems to be an \"infection\" of sorts spreading throughout the Backrooms. It's pretty rare, but I've started to see it on a plethora of different levels and I'm getting worried. I have no clue why no one has written anything about this\u2014surely <em>someone's</em> noticed? There'll be these big roots\u2014dark, twisted, and usually purplish in color\u2014poking out of the ceiling and walls. They're absolutely overgrown with large autumn-colored leaves, which litter the floor around the roots as well. <em>Don't touch the leaves.</em> I've lost several friends already when they grew around our little camp in <a href=\"/level-3\">that one brick-and-bar level.</a></tt></p><br><p><tt>The roots grow incredibly quickly\u2014surrounded us in probably just a few hours. When you touch the leaves, they start to irritate your skin, and you'll eventually feel horrible inside. It hurts so much. I think touching the roots themselves might speed it up even faster than the leaves. Evan grabbed a knife just a few minutes after exposure and tried stabbing himself, my guess would be to end the pain. He bled fucking leaves when he did so. <em>Leaves.</em></tt></p><br><p><tt>I don't know what happened with the bodies. I don't want to know. Stay away from them, stay away from me.</tt></p><br><p><tt>Biology? I don't know\u2026</tt><br/>\n<tt>It's wood, I guess? With leaves? Though I don't even know if it's actually that or some other material, maybe flesh? Would that be possible, even? I have heard of similar things here, but never flesh disguising as a plant specifically.</tt></p><br><p><tt>I don't know the specifics. Jessie, Evan, and Hoyt said that some random, old, crazy guy they ran into had warned them of it, but they never saw him again. After that, we had been seeing patches of the stuff every once in a while, but then, without warning it had grown overnight to block off the whole camp. I don't remember how I escaped, maybe an open gap in the roots. I should have died with my friends. I think I am dying\u2014I feel like my insides are shriveling up.</tt><br/>\n<tt>How has no one else said anything about this? I shouldn't be the one to write about this kind of entity\u2014I'm just a lowly wanderer trying to survive, not an explorer or archivist or something.</tt></p><br><p>\u2026<br/>\nOh.<br/>\nOh god.<br/>\nThis\u2026 needs to be released. No information should be deleted like this, assuming it's serious. Maybe I could rewrite it? Wish the author included a little more information.</p><br><p>Growing in an alleyway.</p><br><p>Holy shit, it's real. I saw a patch in <a href=\"/level-230\">Level 230</a>, back in an alleyway. Just as the deleted article described. Twisting purple-grey roots covered in autumn leaves, similar in shape to those of maple trees but much larger. The ground was also covered in them, piled around loosely, fluttering around in the wind. Whole thing almost looked like a bizarre Halloween decoration; close to a stereotypical \"haunted tree\" or something, just different somehow, in a way I can't quite put my finger on. Perhaps it's more overgrown than normal trees?</p><br><p>Tried showing it to another person, said there was a possible entity a few blocks away that I needed them to check out. When I got back to the alleyway with them, the whole thing was gone save for a few decaying leaves. Kind of lucky I barely knew them and didn't explain it too well, they were pretty pissed. What the hell is this stuff?</p><br><p>Report wasn't kidding when it said it was growing everywhere\u2014I've seen it in all sorts of different places. This stuff spreads fast, but I still haven't heard anyone else say a thing about it, hell if I know why.</p><br><p>Damn it, I'm gonna try to exterminate this shit. Bringing some cheap <a href=\"/object-15\">Firesalt</a> and a knife if that doesn't work, along with thick, protective clothing.</p><br><p><em>Do not try to get rid of this shit, or you <strong>will</strong> die.</em></p><br><p>The leaves burned up quickly from the Firesalt, but not only was the root entirely intact, <em>it regrew the leaves in less than a minute.</em> Hacking at it with the knife was the stupidest decision I have ever made in my now-ending life. It released something like a mix of must, ghoulish-looking crumbled leaves, and what I think were spores, got in between the gaps in my clothing. Now it's just like the page described: my skin is drying out and flaking, and oh Christ does it hurt internally, feels like my guts are withering. Typing this\u2014even <em>getting</em> the energy and willpower <em>to</em> type it\u2014is excruciating. I've been like this for days\u2014even tried stabbing myself to end it. It didn't work, even though I'm pretty sure I heard organs crunching. Do organs crunch?</p><br><p>I'm getting away from everyone\u2014do not try to find me, or you will die. However, I'm still not sure how other people have missed this. It's all over the place now, surrounding me everywhere I go.</p><br><p>I think I get it now.</p><br><p>No one will ever see this\u2014my last connection to other people as I slowly die here in agony. I'm fading away into the shadows, just as so many do in this place. At least my action now will help others. That's the only solace I can get from this mess.

    "description": "<p>At a distance, the Volpe (named after the Corsican word for fox) seems to just be a normal fox. However, getting closer will reveal a second tail and an abnormally long snout.</p><br><p>Volpes are hostile towards wanderers and will try to eat you if they see you nearby. However, if one is wounded, tired, or handicapped in any way, it will do its best to avoid conflict. It may be possible to tame a Volpe, as they are essentially the same as foxes, but this has never been attempted.</p><br><p>In order to protect themselves from low temperatures, Volpes create dens in the ground, much like Frontrooms foxes. However, these dens have multiple levels of rudimentary security, such as large piles of twigs that make a sound when an intruder tries to come in. Volpe dens have lots of branching and interconnecting tunnels, which Volpes have been observed collapsing behind them in order to block predators. There also seems to be a sort of food stash hidden in the back of the den, so they rarely have to worry about going hungry.</p><br><p>The Volpe has evolved a large snout for sniffing out prey. It can also distinguish between wanderers and hostile entities, which is crucial for survival in its habitat. At the time of this article's creation (10/10/2020), it is not known what the dual tails are used for.</p><br><p>Volpe fur is extremely thick and warm, causing a large market to be built around it. A single Volpe pelt can go for up to 20 bottles of <a href=\"/object-1\">Almond Water</a>. A few aspiring businesspeople have started making entire clothing brands around Volpe fur, but environmentalists are afraid that this hunting may cause Volpes to go extinct.</p><br><p>The Volpe was first photographed by <a href=\"/aether48\">Aether48</a> on a search for supplies in <a href=\"/level-135\">Level 135</a>. However, the camera flash alerted the Volpe to his presence, and it nearly tore off his arm.</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/entity-119\">Entity 119 - \"Volpes\"</a>\" by Aether48, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

    "description": "<p><strong>The Officinarum</strong> is a highly dangerous artificial intelligence created accidentally by the M.E.G. It was given the mission to kill hostile entities that might pose a threat to humans, without the thought that humans themselves are considered entities and can pose a threat to each other. Pictures of it <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">have</span> been taken, but they have all been removed within seconds of being put up. We believe that this is due to the tampering of <strong>The Officinarum</strong>, but luckily it has not removed anything beyond the photographs.</p><br><p><em>A newspaper clipping from the 1920s. This is the closest thing to a photo of The Officinarum we have.</em></p><br><p><strong>The Officinarum</strong> stalks the backrooms, using its multiple built-in rifles to destroy any wanderers or entities in its path. There is only one in existence so an encounter is extremely rare, but do not let your guard down. This entity has been observed no-clipping, so it is theoretically able to enter any level. In accordance with its programming, it will kill any dangerous entities, but wanderers seem to have the priority in its \"kill queue\".</p><br><p><strong>The Officinarum</strong> is an extremely hostile AI, created by the M.E.G. with the sole intention of protecting wanderers from hostile entities. However, as soon as it gained self-awareness, it classified humans as hostile entities and started killing them instead. Its chassis is comprised entirely out of reinforced tungsten, so it is extremely hard to damage. Do not engage it under any circumstances until we can find a way to harm it.<br/>\n<strong>The Officinarum</strong> is built like a stereotypical 1940s robot, with a blocky torso and limbs. However, do not let this fool you into thinking it is less intelligent and evil than it actually is.

    "description": "<p><span class=\"Serif\">Entity 121, better known as Bone Thieves, are massive, potato-shaped beings with bumpy, sickly, yellow skin, that is practically impervious to all manmade forms of weaponry. Excluding highly technological items outside of the Backrooms, such as nuclear weapons.</span></p><br><p></p><br><p><span class=\"Serif\">The Bone Thieves are stationary predators that rely on their ability to mimic the noises of both humans and entities to draw prey near and make them boneless. Their anatomy hasn't been properly examined to decipher how the Bone Thief can mimic so accurately. It is theorized that these entities must possess a highly developed larynx and temporal lobe to remember and utilize various voices.</span></p><br><p><span class=\"Serif\">How their prey becomes boneless upon meeting their gaze is unknown. Where and what happens to the bones during and after removal is equally a mystery. The removal of their prey's bones is impossibly swift and clean.</span></p><br><p><span class=\"Serif\">What is noted is that their bone-thieving powers can only be focused on one individual, therefore someone can see their eyes, as long as they're not the one having their bones be removed.</span></p><br><p></p><br><p><span class=\"Serif\">Bone Thieves possess a large, gaping mouth that houses its eyes. The flesh within its maw is slick, colored hauntingly close to Vantablack as any texture definition cannot be viewed. This entity's jaw strength is immense, without any gum line or teeth to chew through, it must stick to a strict, no-bone diet. The two orifices on the sides of its head ooze a sort of liquid that helps keep its skin moist; which has a distinctive blue hue.</span></p><br><p><span class=\"Serif\">When a Bone Thief makes a kill, it will extend its \"neck\" to reach out and slurp up the boneless corpse. Thereby implicating that this entity has some form of inner structure.</span></p><br><p><span class=\"Serif\">Bone Thieves have never been observed to defecate or urinate. However, they have been observed regurgitating items that cannot be digested, such as articles of clothing, bags, or other manmade objects.</span></p><br><p><span class=\"Serif\">When a Bone Thief is done feeding, their skin turns to a duller hue and they close their mouths. Thereby nullifying their bone-thieving capabilities for at least a week as they digest their last meal.</span></p><br><p></p><br><p><span class=\"Serif\">Bone Thieves were first encountered by a wanderer whilst on a scavenging mission with another wanderer in <a href=\"/level-4\">Level 4</a>. At one point during their stroll, the pair came across an instance of Entity 121. The wanderer who told the story was unaffected, but their friend did not survive the encounter.</span></p><br><p><span class=\"Serif\">The entity was stated to seamlessly remove the other wanderer's bones without a single sound being made, leaving the visually unharmed corpse of the wanderer boneless and without support. The body fell to the ground, and the Bone Thief scooped the body up, closing its jaw as soon as the body was fully consumed. At this point, the wanderer who told the tale fled the scene, fearing the same fate for themselves.</span></p><br><p></p><br><p><span class=\"Serif\">Although rare, Bone Thieves are capable of minimal movement and will migrate when they feel that their current territory will not sustain them. Their approximate speed can be compared to that of a lethargic sloth.</span></p><br><p><span class=\"Serif\">It is theorized that the victim's bones are teleported to a different dimension when being removed. Although no evidence has been brought forth to support this claim.</span></p><br><p></p><br><p></p><br><p><span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/smith-machine\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7306759); return false;\"><img alt=\"Smith Machine\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7306759&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334089\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7306759)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/smith-machine\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7306759); return false;\">Smith Machine</a></span><br/>\nIllustration by <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/smith-machine\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7306759); return false;\"><img alt=\"Smith Machine\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7306759&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334089\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7306759)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/smith-machine\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7306759); return false;\">Smith Machine</a></span></p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/entity-120\">Entity 120</a> | Entity 121 | <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/entity-122\">Entity 122</a> \u00bb</p><br>",

    "description": "<p>Entity 123 is a spectral being responsible for terrorizing, as well as the injury and demise of, several residents of these Backrooms. A highly credible source has supplied the <a href=\"/the-m-e-g\">M.E.G.</a> with details about an identical modus operandi and mysterious death in the <a href=\"/the-frontrooms\">Frontrooms</a>.</p><br><p>It all begins when the name of the victim appears in an unexpected place. Our names are an important part of our identity. They carry meaning and have deep personal and historical connections. Occultists refer to the \"Law of Names\" and believe that knowing the \"true name\" of any supernatural being grants them some power over it. This law also warns that supernatural beings, using your name, might be able to steal who you are or end your life. This entity has one all-consuming behavior: its obsession and compulsion with our names.</p><br><p>Entity 123 is not a living creature as we understand biology. It often takes the form of an evil doppelganger (or double) of the victim. It can manifest as a horrifying event or circumstances beyond the victim's control, with every encounter revolving around the name of its prey.</p><br><p>The Backrooms is vast beyond <a href=\"/entity-1\">human</a> comprehension and description. This is not a tender place or a honeymoon destination. People constantly die here. It was by chance that the M.E.G. recently realized that these particular tragedies were the work of a single intelligence.</p><br><p>This is a comparative sampling of witness statements and interviews. As this investigation continues, the Major Explorer Group realizes that most victims do not survive these events.</p><br><p>My best friend in the Backrooms, Freddie Ford, never stopped playing the fool or being the center of attention. Funny or not, that skinny idiot always had my back as we tried to make the best of our situation. Nothing romantic.</p><br><p>We were following the dirt path on Level 10, hoping to see if the rumors about legendary baked goods were true. There, in the middle of nowhere, was this beat-up, red mailbox on a wooden post. Painted on it in crude white letters was the name <strong>Fred Ford</strong>.</p><br><p>Freddie looks it over, does a little dance, and sings, \"I gots mail.\" He opens it up before I could stop him and pulls out an envelope. \"It\u2019s got my old address and everything! There\u2019s more in here.\"</p><br><p>He reaches in, and his arm disappears up to the armpit. Freddie is crying and trying to pull free. I only see his terrified face for a second before his head disappears inside the mailbox. You can hardly hear his muffled screams over the crunching of the mailbox eating him. Crunch. Crunch. Crunch. Then his legs and feet are gone and the mailbox closes. I run until I pass out from exhaustion.</p><br><p>(Signed)<br/>\nWendy Jacobs</p><br><p><em><strong>M.E.G.

I walked up the path, toward the laughter, toward the picnic tables and the kids and folks gorging themselves on barbecued chicken. (He starts to sob, then laughs, then sobs.)</p><br><p><strong>Rhinehart</strong>: Was this your family?</p><br><p><strong>Adler</strong>: Nobody stopped eating, but they all turned now to look at me, all at the exact same time. The exact same time in the exact same way. It caught me off guard and something seemed wrong.. They all said the same thing at once. \"More chicken! There's more chicken!\" And then, I realized that they weren't eating barbecued chicken. They weren't eating barbecued chicken!</p><br><p><strong>Rhinehart</strong>: What were they eating?</p><br><p><strong>Adler</strong>: They weren't eating barbecued chicken!

This is why I am intrigued to learn what information you might possibly have to aid our investigation.</p><br><p><strong>Taylor</strong>: Two years ago, dispatch tells us that we had a 10-51, subject is drunk, at Buddy\u2019s Bar and Grill. The tavern went as far as calling for a cab. He waits outside for the taxi and then rushes back inside like the Devil was after him. He said that the taxi had a <strong>Habersham Taxi Company</strong> decal on the door and that the driver was his demonic twin. The drunk's name was Habersham. That made it so weird. When the bartender went out to check the parking lot, it was empty.</p><br><p><strong>Rhinehart</strong>: Was there a Habersham Taxi Company?</p><br><p><strong>Taylor</strong>: There wasn't. The real taxi arrived after we took Habersham into custody.</p><br><p><strong>Rhinehart</strong>: So you did pick him up?</p><br><p><strong>Taylor</strong>: We took him into civil protective custody and delivered him to the designated sobering cell or \"drunk tank\" at the county jail. The guy became a rowdy mess and the officer on duty had to warn him to be quiet five or six times. Drunks can be like that. Anyways, he finally quiets down. When they check the cell in the morning, Habersham is not only dead, but most of his body is missing. Eaten! Just the head and torso remain. None of the cameras caught anything. He was a transient and the investigation went nowhere. Probably still open.</p><br><p><strong>Rhinehart</strong>: This was in the Frontrooms?</p><br><p><strong>Rhinehart</strong>: Iowa is about as Frontrooms as it gets.</p><br><p><strong>END LOG</strong></p><br><p><em><strong>M.E.G.

I am Doctor Rhinehart.</p><br><p><strong>Fields</strong>: Is Anne Dunne with you?</p><br><p><strong>Dunne</strong>: I'm here, Lavender. What a beautiful name. (The young blonde in the hospital bed is covered with lacerations from head to toe and her eyes are bandaged.)</p><br><p><strong>Fields</strong>: Thank you, Anne. My mother was hopelessly addicted to romance novels. Will my story help others?</p><br><p><strong>Dunne</strong>: Let's help you first. Please, tell us what happened.</p><br><p><strong>Fields</strong>: I was in this quaint bookstore on Level 11. I had some items to trade and desperately wanted to hold a book in my hands again. On a nostalgic whim, I picked up a handful of romance novels and shuffled through the titles, stopping at <em>Love Cuts Deep</em>. The girl on the cover could've been me and the author's name was <strong>Lavender Fields</strong>. My photo was on the back cover! My mother took that picture at a party the summer before I no-clipped here. I got lightheaded and noticed drops of blood spattering the book. I was bleeding.</p><br><p><strong>Rhinehart</strong>: The M.E.G. will attempt to recover that novel.</p><br><p><strong>Dunne</strong>: (Taking Lavender's hand \u2026) You have some tangles. Let me brush your pretty hair while we talk. (Anne Dunne pulls an <a href=\"/annes-escape\">antique brass hairbrush</a> from her satchel and begins to brush the girl's hair. Lavender immediately relaxes.)</p><br><p><strong>Fields</strong>: There was a display for selling reading glasses in the bookstore, so I checked my face in the mirror. (She starts to cry.) It was like someone with an invisible knife was cutting my cheeks and forehead. Every time that I checked my reflection, new cuts got longer and deeper. If my arms were reflected, painful cuts slowly appeared there. I made it home somehow and covered all of the reflective surfaces in my apartment with towels. Any reflection would trigger the cuts.</p><br><p><strong>Dunne</strong>: The psychic negativity is gone. (She stows the hairbrush.) Old cuts will heal now. No new cuts should appear.</p><br><p><strong>Rhinehart</strong>: Maybe you should rest, Miss Fields.</p><br><p><strong>Fields</strong>: I'm good. Thank you, Anne. It didn't take long before I realized that looking at any part of my body, even the clothed parts, caused cuts to appear. Deeper cuts.</p><br><p><strong>Dunne</strong>: That is when you blinded yourself and the medics brought you here?</p><br><p><strong>Fields</strong>: Yes.</p><br><p><strong>END LOG</strong></p><br><p><em><strong>M.E.G.

No anomalous phenomena reported at this time.</em></p><br><p>Man-eater?<br/>\nBlood and tissue<br/>\nwere found inside.<br/>\nM.E.G. Archives</p><br><p>The Major Explorer Group Team \"Epiphany\" consists of Dr. John Rhinehart, PhD (<em>science</em>), Amy Cochrane (<em>swords</em>), and Anne Dunne (<em>psychic</em>). This trio has recovered the physical objects from several scenes of these tragedies for study and safekeeping. Other evidence, such as buildings, et cetera, could not reasonably be removed for further examination. In those instances, the evidence was photographed and otherwise documented. The tangible proof was compared to the recorded testimony of witnesses and survivors.</p><br><p>There are no easy answers. The objects collected do not demonstrate anomalous properties. Contrary to the testimony of witnesses and survivors, the objects are no longer \"personalized\" with the names of the victims and are often somewhat different than described. These differences appear to be the result of altered reality and are not hallucinatory in nature.</p><br><p>Coming to any meaningful conclusions about Entity 123 is a challenge. Physical creatures such as <a href=\"/entity-25\">Plague Goblins</a>, <a href=\"/entity-10\">Skin-Stealers</a>, and <a href=\"/entity-134\">Phobic Centipedes</a> can be located with effort, observed, and, if necessary, killed. Spectral entities do not offer humans such luxuries.</p><br><p>Anne Dunne is currently employing clairvoyance and psychometry to level the playing field. Psychometry (or token-object reading) is the ability to discover facts about events or persons by touching inanimate objects somehow associated with them. It is a form of extrasensory perception, or ESP. Her talents are amazing.</p><br><p>Team \"Epiphany\" is tasked with investigating the recent death of one M.E.G. official and the disappearance of one of their cartographers. Psychometry wins the day.</p><br><p><strong>Main Hall (<a href=\"/level-5\">Level 5</a>)</strong> - Without hesitation, Anne Dunne walks straight to an oil painting of a man fishing. The brass nameplate on the frame reads \"Catch and Release.\" According to the records held in Rhinehart's possession, this was the exact spot where the mangled body of the M.E.G. official from Outpost \"House Keeping\" was discovered, although all stains from the carnage are gone. The following is a transcript from Dunne's token-object reading of the painting:</p><br><p>(Anne runs the <a href=\"/annes-farewell\">purple fingers</a> of her right hand along the gilded frame, never touching the actual painting, and stops at the nameplate. There is no dust.) <em>A name is now here, <strong>Benjamin Warner</strong>, on the nameplate \u2026 Ben is puzzled.</em> (Anne begins to breathe heavily and stiffens.) <em>The fisherman is moving \u2026 He looks like Ben \u2026 His eyes are fire! \u2026 He's climbing out of the painting \u2026 Ben can't speak \u2026 Ben can't move! \u2026So many teeth \u2026 Too many teeth!</em> (Dunne places both hands on the painting and says, \"Let me see you for once, fiend.\") <em>The entity is darkness without form \u2026 I see it feed \u2026 I feel the the slow tearing of flesh and hear the crushing of bone \u2026 This is not about nourishment \u2026 This is about inflicting pain and torture \u2026 About vengeance \u2026 About the bloodline.</em> (This is like all of the others. These attacks are not random, not by chance. Once again, there is purpose here.)</p><br><p><strong>One Lonely Grave (<a href=\"/level-710\">Level 710</a>)</strong> - The ruins of an abandoned cabin are discovered about half a day's walk from Harbinger Lake (formerly Harbinger Arch). A single gravestone is found at the base of a hill, fifty meters from the cabin. The weathered headstone is poured from concrete and decorated with colorful pebbles, with the name written upon it while the cement was still wet. The deceased is \"Elena Lopez - Wife and Mother.\" Clairvoyance has led the M.E.G Team \"Epiphany\" to this gravesite and the gruesome remains atop the settler's grave. Papers identify the man as the missing M.E.G. cartographer. Dunne kneels opposite the body and begins her token-object reading of the grave marker:</p><br><p><em>The grave is unkept and the obscured stone reads \"Alex Mars\u2014\" Alex clears the weeds and freezes on all fours \u2026 The stone reads <strong>Alex Marshall - Cartographer</strong> \u2026 Bony hands burst from the ground and seize his arms \u2026 A rotting female face with glowing eyes and a shark's mouth sprouts from the grave and laughs \u2026 It boasts that it found another name \u2026 Such hatred and arrogance.</em> (Dunne breaks off the reading early and says softly, \"I know its true name.\")</p><br><p style=\"text-align: center;\">The \"true name\" of Entity 123 is <strong>Rodixidor</strong>.</p><br><p>After much deliberation, this information has been released by the Major Explorer Group in an effort to reduce further loss of human life.

Entity 124 can cause confusion, lightheadedness, dizziness, and temporary memory loss. The strength of these effects is proportionate to the distance from it.</p><br><p>Other than distorting your brain signals at close proximity, it is also capable of making deals and signing contracts, with the main currency traded being memories. Memories can be borrowed, sold, or traded for another memory of the same value, all according to the entity's valuations. Each memory has different values but can be categorized into 2 groups: \"Pain\" and \"Joy\". If you trade for new memories, \"Pain\" is the better option as it is not only beneficial to you, but its value is also higher when compared to \"Joy\". If you're trading for objects or power like cash, intelligence, etc, \"Joy\" will be superior compared to \"Pain\". Their value is determined by how important or triggering that memory is to you, the more it is, the higher the value of that memory. Sometimes trades accommodate for knowledge<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup>, fame, or physical abilities like better eyesight, stronger limbs, and many more. Other than raw memories, trades with memory jars can also be done, which function the same.</p><br><p>After a trade, the victim will not remember anything about the encounter, the deal, or the entity's presence, simply living like nothing had occurred. It is not exactly known what entity 124 can do, but based on the transcripted audio file from underneath, it is clear that The Memory Merchant can and will kill humans in certain situations.</p><br><p>The entity is presumably believed to be unable to move, as none of the videotapes had recorded its traversing method. However, every time a new victim may stumble upon its grasp, a completely new and dissimilar environment from the previous is formed. From this, it's possible that entity 124 either only moves when it's not in an interaction, or that its surroundings constantly change.</p><br><p>In testing, it is confirmed that victims during the encounter with Entity 124 will stay asleep no matter the disturbance of the environment or damage to the body. The victim also won't be clipping out of <a href=\"/level-9\">Level 9</a> as long as they stay within 124's pocket dimension (or supposedly <a href=\"/level-227\">Level 227</a>).</p><br><p>Entity 124 is normally neutral and composed. However, in some extraordinary circumstances, it can be agitated and may even cause harm. It talks in a psychic-type sound wave that can't be recorded by capturing devices, however, still creates statics and blurs video recordings. Its voice is described as warm and nostalgic, almost sounding like the entity had been met and befriended a long time ago. It also seems highly sensitive towards contents relating to <a href=\"/level-9\">Level 9</a>, and talking about it may cause the entity to lose its temper, usually leading to casualty. Communication with the entity will decide whether one may survive or perish.</p><br><p>A blurry photograph of Entity 124<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')\">3</a></sup>.</p><br><p>Entity 124 appears to be a floating <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellated_octahedron\">stellated octahedron</a><sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-4\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')\">4</a></sup> with side lengths of approximately 12 meters in its \"base form\". The within of its structure is completely transparent, most likely hollow. Entity 124 has a light magenta hue on its main body and a blinding lime glow surrounding it. However, the entity can modify its appearance, shape, size, or color, and seemingly has no limit in doing so. Physical interactions with the entity have proven ineffective, possibly implying that the entity is either non-physical or exists on strange virtual dimensions.</p><br><p>Entity 124's discovery was very late thanks to its memory-wiping abilities, which hindered wanderers' ability to describe its existence after leaving its domain<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-5\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')\">5</a></sup>. It was finally discovered on 13/Aug/2023 by an unknown person via an audio file from a recorder. The recorder was found lying on a bed in one of <a href=\"/level-9\">Level 9</a>'s houses, likely turned on accidentally while they were slumbering.

    "title": "- \"The Scarecrows\"",
    "description": "<p>Entity 126, also known as \"The Scarecrows\", are a group of mysterious entities that reside in various random locations around Level 10. Not much is known about them thus far, but experiments are currently underway to uncover more information. Appearance-wise, they seem to be nearly identical in constitution to common scarecrows in baseline reality, with the exception of the presence of variations of <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-24\">Object 24</a> attached to their faces. Based on testing, instances of Entity 126 seem to be able to contain any known variation of Object 24. No instances have been seen outside of Level 10, and only one instance can be seen at any time in any given area. Due to this, the amount of instances of Entity 126 that inhabit Level 10 is uncountable, since its anomalous properties make it undeterminable if any newly-sighted scarecrows are simply already known ones appearing in different places.</p><br><p>At first glance, Entity 126 appears stationary. There are no signs of sentience or organic qualities when looking at them. However, taking eyes off of the entities for an undeterminable amount of time will cause them to seemingly teleport to a random location. Any period of time in which they are not in your sight will come with the possibility of movement \u2014 even blinking. There are no tracks or prints in the ground after they move, and Entity 126 has been reported to be able to disappear and reappear in places far enough away in a small enough amount of time that it can be said they have the ability to move faster than the speed of light. Keeping Entity 126 in your vision appears to prevent it from moving, as it will always remain stationary until you take your eyes off of it.</p><br><p>After moving, Entity 126 instances will always be facing the nearest wanderer directly, regardless of their previous orientation or if the wanderer changes their position. This ensures that when a wanderer looks at an instance of Entity 126, they will always be looking directly into their eyes. There is no visible face behind the masks of the scarecrows, and as such wanderers have described their eyes as \"\"dark pits that suck you in like a black hole\". Looking into their eyes for any period of time will cause wanderers to have an irresistible urge to immediately travel to the scarecrow, remove the instance of Object 24 from its visage, and don it themselves.</p><br><p>Entity 126 exhibits the ability to also change locations in digital depictions of itself, such as photography, video, 3D recreations, and even sonar technology. Mediums in which a representation of their face is visible will also cause wanderers to become obsessed with finding them donning their masks if such a representation is viewed. This persists across all levels, regardless of distance or circumstance. If wanderers do not know how to get to Level 10 from whatever level they are currently in, they will devote all their resources into finding the quickest way possible. Wanderers under the effect are prone to irrational and illogical decisions, such as quitting their job at the M.E.G. without warning in order to reach Level 10 and wear the mask. Wanderers under this effect will also not eat, sleep, or drink, and are prone to dying of bodily deprivation if they cannot reach the scarecrow in time.</p><br><p>This effect is unavoidable no matter what method wanderers use to view the scarecrows. Cameras, glasses, sunglasses, water glasses, telescopes, binoculars, and any semi-transparent materials do not prevent wanderers from being affected. Wanderers who are blind do not fall victim to Entity's anomalous properties through vision, but will still feel the irresistible urge to wear the masks if they happen to touch a scarecrow. The same is true for <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-9\">Facelings.</a></p><br><p>There is no known way to destroy an instance of Entity 126. Fire, spears, knives, and all other conceivable and available tools and weaponry have proven to leave no distinguishable marks. Sightings of Entity 126 have been recorded for the past hundreds of years throughout several ancient journals, and recently-sighted instances seem to posses the exact same appearances and qualities as they did in the past. It is therefore unknown if there is any possible way that Entity 126 can ever be destroyed other than the following example: Taking an instance of Object 24 from an instance of Entity 126 will cause it to crumble and fall apart into a substance so fine that it cannot be detected nor contained.</p><br><p>Wanderers who have been affected by Object 24 have shown no signs of being affected by Entity 126. It can assumed that Entity 126 only affects those who have never been previously exposed to Object 24. Once an instance of Object 24 taken from Entity 126 is worn, wanderers will experience all the standard symptoms of Object 24 instances found elsewhere, such as expressing an intense and irrational desire to kill or maim any nearby humans. Because of this, as of August 2nd, 2021, experimentation and attempting to obtain any further information has been deemed too risky and costly to human life and has been prohibited for the foreseeable future, express order of Overseer A.</p><br><p><iframe allowtransparency=\"true\" class=\"html-block-iframe\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"/fragment:entity-126-0/html/9401009bfaf8e3a6a32a12c0a81518a62d9bc185-16246631871255997275\"></iframe></p><br><p><span style=\"color: black\">This draft is now given a</span> <span style=\"color: red\"><strong>red flag.</strong></span> <span style=\"color: black\">It is never to be published on the official M.E.G. Database, nor is it to be altered in any way, shape, or form from this moment onwards. We have decided that releasing this information would only bring more harm upon the community, as knowledge of this entity would cause far more casualties and victims of Object 24 than if it remained unknown. The reason for this is both because images of the entity are incredibly dangerous and because we are still unsure whether or not knowledge about this entity may also cause its anomalous effects. We may still continue to lose innocent wanderers who encounter them on their own, but it is a much lesser evil than risking losing even more lives due to experimentation and investigation.</span></p><br><p><span style=\"color: black\">Our hearts grieve for the brave volunteers that we have lost in our pursuit of knowledge and safety. Their willingness to give and devote their lives to maintaining and preserving a safe environment for the entire wanderer community of the Backrooms is truly commendable. Though there is no public celebration for their great achievements, their sacrifices are just as valuable. While this article will never be published, what we will not forget is what these brave souls gave to us.

    "description": "<p><strong>Growlers</strong> are massive, hulking Entities that should be avoided when possible. They are always slouching due to their tentacular limbs. They are a variety of colors and are generally highly dangerous.</p><br><p><strong>Growlers</strong> will roam their home Levels aimlessly, however if it senses prey, it will rapidly move toward it and kill it. It seems to prefer humans or cats to any other creature, although it has been known to kill <a href=\"/entity-10\">Skin-Stealers</a> or similar Entities. One peculiar property is that upon entering a new Level, their simple brain will be completely overwhelmed and they will often die of shock. Another strange behavior is that upon encountering another of its species, they will merge to become doubly large and twice as intelligent. These forms are highly dangerous and will almost definitely kill you. When it encounters prey, it will rapidly begin to telepathically play \"growling\" sounds (or white noise) to confuse and startle its prey. At close range, the larger ones can cause brain damage with this ability. It will then stumble toward the target. Upon reaching the target, hundreds of the rib-like pipe cleaner extrusions will extend, and attempt to impale and kill the prey. At the same time, the entity itself will attempt to bludgeon the prey to death with its whiplike tendrils. Once the prey has expired the entity will open its chest cavity and absorb the prey, then seal itself back up. It will proceed grow more pipe cleaners and expand its body.</p><br><p><strong>Growlers</strong> appear to be a massive, vaguely humanoid mass of multicolored pipe cleaners. They are completely blind and instead rely on a form of echolocation. They can range from 4 to a towering 15 feet tall. They have short legs and long arms. Both sets of limbs end in a tangle of wires and pipe cleaners, which drag on the ground behind it. It has several short, sharp extrusions of wire resembling small ribs on its torso. It lacks all organs with the exception of a central nervous system.</p><br><p>This Entity was discovered by u/beaneater69 when he posted a picture of one with the caption \"WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?\" before his account went permanently silent. It is assumed the entity killed and absorbed him.</p><br><p>You can tell if one is nearby due to the white noise effect. This can affect anywhere from only 10 meters to up to 80.</p><br><p>They are incredibly stupid.</p><br><p>Oddly enough, they emit wi-fi and charge electronic devices. Captive members of the species have been used by rogue groups as charger stations. This is not recommended due to their mind-altering effects.</p><br><p><span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/cementsandwich\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6931847); return false;\"><img alt=\"CementSandwich\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=6931847&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334082\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=6931847)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/cementsandwich\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6931847); return false;\">CementSandwich</a></span></p><br><p>Sandboxes: <a href=\"http://backrooms-sandbox-2.wikidot.com/cementsandwich\">http://backrooms-sandbox-2.wikidot.com/cementsandwich</a>, <a href=\"http://backrooms-sandbox-2.wikidot.com/cementsandwich-2\">http://backrooms-sandbox-2.wikidot.com/cementsandwich-2</a></p><br><p>Contact thru Discord - CementSandwich#6601</p><br><p>image by <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/aether48\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6926379); return false;\"><img alt=\"Aether48\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=6926379&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334082\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=6926379)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/aether48\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6926379); return false;\">Aether48</a></span></p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/entity-129\">Entity 129</a> | Entity 130 | <a href=\"/entity-131\">Entity 131</a> \u00bb</p><br>",

They appear to not be as sentient as a regular employee, unable to speak beside the noises that emanate from their head, and only able to accomplish simple movements.</p><br><p>Instead of a regular insignia that would regularly designate rank based on the metal used, all insignias on <strong>Entity 132</strong> instances are replaced by cloth patches ironed on to their berets; This may suggest that <strong>Entity 132</strong> instances are the lowest possible rank, perhaps used as a punishment for Employees who fail their purpose. More research pending.</p><br><p><strong>Entity 132</strong> instances can be found throughout the Backrooms appearing to wander in any direction. Compared to their higher-ranking counterparts in Backrooms Remodeling Co., they are considerably less able to perform cognitive function and movement. They appear to only be able to do simple actions, most commonly waving upon noticing something. They also do not appear to register anything said to them, only sometimes tilting their head in confusion.</p><br><p>While a definite function has not been proven yet, they seem to be used for advertisement for Backrooms Remodeling Co.

A M.E.G officer found this book in <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/Level-11\">Level 11</a>, containing the conversation between The Mail Carrier and <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/Entity-140\">Entity 140</a>, also known as <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/Entity-140\">Blanche</a>.</em></p><br><p>The Mail Carrier is an entity that delivers mail to people in the Frontrooms. Unlike the mail carriers in the Frontrooms, the only type of \"mail\" it handles are the diaries and journals of those who have unfortunately succumbed to the horrors of the Backrooms. The Mail Carrier is currently working with Blanche. The details of their connection is documented in <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/the-contract\">The Contract</a>.</p><br><p>There are very few reports on how The Mail Carrier behaves, but it is well known that it is somewhat shy, and is unwilling to show itself to wanderers.</p><br><p>A certain group that call themselves the Informants have claimed to be able to have short conversations with this entity using unorthodox methods.</p><br><p><strong>Log 1\u00a011:20 a.m. 5/1</strong></p><br><p>-st. Test. Oh, it finally connected! Um. To start things off, we are the Informants. Charmed, I'm sure. Can't really properly introduce ourselves because we're currently on a time limit before this level becomes hostile again, but my name is Page. I'm the current second-in-command of the Informants and in charge of posting here when we Informants rotate to this level, which has this computer I'm using right now. This is the only source of the internet we have discovered.<br/>\n<em>Anyway</em>, we finally found this page and decided to contribute as much as we could! Due to time restrictions, can't do much, but a\u2014</p><br><p><strong>Log 2\u00a011:21 a.m. 5/3</strong></p><br><p>Sorry about that, I wasn't paying attention at the time. Now about how we contacted The Mail Carrier.</p><br><p>Our method is quite inconvenient if you want to have a normal conversation with it. But at the same time, I don't think it can speak. So, this is the only currently known way of communication. This method involves using the sticky notes The Mail Carrier sometimes uses.</p><br><p>If one were to find a lost diary before The Mail Carrier retrieves it, the wanderer can write it a message with anything at hand: paper, tissue, strips of clothes, etc. Once the message is finished, slip it between the diary, and wait for The Mail Carrier to arrive. When it is near, you may feel mildly uncomfortable, as if you were being watched. It's <em>okay</em>, you're not gonna die or anything. Once you have confirmed its presence, place the lost diary (with your message) down on the ground, and leave the room you are currently in. (Going out of sight of the diary should be enough.)<br/>\nAfter some time, when one returns to the place the diary was, the diary will be replaced with a sticky note written by The Mail Carrier itself. It will hold the reply to your message, as a thank you from it.</p><br><p><strong>Log 3\u00a011:29 a.m. 5/3</strong></p><br><p>I'm back! I forgot to add that any question longer than 10 words will only be replied with, \"Thank You.\"</p><br><p>The Mail Carrier's appearance differs when in the Backrooms and in the Frontrooms.</p><br><p>All descriptions of The Mail Carrier's appearance within the Backroooms are different. There have been multiple sights of this entity being an animal, human, or even an object. Despite this, all of the wanderers who have claimed to see it had one detail in common\u2014its tall, slim figure approximately 1.5 times the height of the average human.</p><br><p><strong>Log 4\u00a011:19\u00a05/5</strong><br/>\nFun fact from Page No.1! One of the other Informants told me they saw The Mail Carrier appear as a shadow of a walking tree! Funny right? Right? <em>(Now that I think of it, perhaps no one's even reading this\u2026)</em></p><br><p>The Mail Carrier\u2019s appearance in the Frontrooms is similar to its appearance in the Backrooms, albeit more humanoid. However, it maintains its height and its long, slender legs. It wears a butler outfit and a top hat. It carries a brown leather briefcase, holding it protectively as it strides across the road. It is believed that the briefcase possesses fourth-dimensional properties, making it easier for the entity to hold a large number of diaries.</p><br><p><strong>Log 5\u00a011:23\u00a05/5</strong><br/>\nFun fact by Page No. 2! This has been confirmed by a sticky note, and <em>I</em> was the one to ask it! It was a little cumbersome to get this answer because I was in <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/Level-0\">Level 0</a> at the time. <em>(I can still hear the buzzing sounds in my head.)</em></p><br><p>The Mail Carrier was first seen by a wanderer in Level 0 named <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/alice-morningstar\">Alice Morningstar</a>, who picked up <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/Object-96\">Object 96.1</a> after The Mail Carrier dropped it. Alice wasn't familiar with this entity, nor could she hold a conversation with it due to it dissolving within the shadows as soon as she picked the book up.</p><br><p><strong>Log 6\u00a011:20\u00a05/7</strong><br/>\nFun fact by Page No.3! Alice is our current leader! (Very nice person btw.) This moment is what lead the Informants to form! I also linked her story of this encounter somewhere around here, so be sure to check it out!</p><br><p>The Mail Carrier isn't hostile to wanderers, but it can provoke indirect negative effects on those who are unlucky enough to experience them. Some of them are:</p><br><p>\u30fbFeeling of paranoia when stalked by The Mail Carrier for holding onto a lost diary.</p><br><p>\u30fbDisappearing within a week after reading The Mail (Lost diaries mailed by The Mail Carrier) in the Frontrooms.</p><br><p>\u30fbOdd behaviors when reading and subsequent to reading The Mail given by the entity.</p><br><p><strong>Log 7\u00a011:20\u00a05/9</strong><br/>\nFun fact by Page No 4! I had my fair share of paranoia when I was a normal wanderer. But when I accidentally found one of these diaries, the feeling of being watched got stronger, like a constant chill down my spine. It was about two days after picking the diary up when I thought I was going crazy, but fortunately, I ran into Alice. She helped me by letting me join the Informants. After some time, I rose to the position of second-in-command. Neat, right?</p><br><p>Admin permission denied.</p><br><p>Because of all the places The Mail Carrier goes to collect lost diaries, this entity is believed to possess the ability to traverse all levels in the Backrooms. How it does this, however, is unknown.<br/>\nThere is one level in particular where it lingers for a majority of the time. This level is <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-906\">Level 906</a>, also known as The Cygnus Archive.</p><br><p>There have been multiple sightings of The Mail Carrier within \"The Panicking State\" of <a href=\"/level-186\">Level 186</a>. It is theorized that it uses this level as a rest point.</p><br><p>There is one level that The Mail Carrier <strong>never</strong> enters\u2014 <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/Level-Fun\">Level Fun</a>. This entity cannot retrieve lost diaries in Level Fun, as it keeps away from partygoers at all times. The reason appears to be connected with The Mail Carrier\u2019s master, documented in The Contract.</p><br><p>The Mail Carrier can be seen in the Backrooms retrieving lost diaries. When a wanderer holds onto a lost diary, this entity may stalk them for extended periods of time, leading weak-minded wanderers to suffer symptoms of paranoia. When in this situation, one of three outcomes will happen.</p><br><p>\u30fbThe Mail Carrier will eventually lose interest in the lost diary and leave it in the hands of the wanderer.</p><br><p>\u30fb If the diary is placed on the floor and left behind, The Mail Carrier can and will retrieve it.</p><br><p>\u30fb In rare cases, it will be stolen while one is asleep. In such cases, the wanderer will find a sticky note on their belongings that says \"Sorry.\"</p><br><p>One can also see The Mail Carrier in the Frontrooms if they happen to be nearby when it delivers mail to people. One can sometimes catch glimpses of The Mail Carrier retreating in long, smooth strides if they were to open their front door fast enough when receiving mail from it.</p><br><p><strong>Log 8 ??:?? a.m. 5/14325347</strong><br/>\nFun fact by Page No.5!

They will not do anything except read the mail until it is finished. One person kept reading for 4 days straight, which led to severe sleep deprivation and dehydration.</p><br><p>Any attempt to enter the closed room will result in the person screaming at them, telling them to not come in. If one were to barge into the room regardless, they would find that the person has disappeared. Trying to make contact with people that have disappeared in this way has not yielded any results.</p><br><p>After they have finished reading the mail, they will immediately erase the mail by any means necessary, usually by burning it. Since the room is closed, smoke inhalation may cause the person to develop chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma. When burning it isn't an option, they will rip the mail into shreds using tools, teeth, bare hands, and other methods. Once shredded, they will proceed to swallow the remnants of the mail.</p><br><p>When the person comes out of the room, they will have no recollection of most of these actions. Even when confronted with solid proof, they will deny it and say that they only remember reading the diary that was mailed to them, claiming to not know its current whereabouts.</p><br><p>Most people who have finished reading the mail will go missing in a week. This has been proven to be avoidable. If a person who has read the mail were to be watched for a week, they will be safe from disappearance. This is confirmed by The Mail Carrier itself in The Contract.</p><br><p><strong>Log 9\u00a011:22 a.m. 5/15</strong><br/>\nFun Fact by Page No.6! Okay, I guess this isn't really \"fun\" because of the topic at hand, but we tried to ask The Mail Carrier what happened to those who disappeared, who only replied with, \"I do not know.\"</p><br><p>Admin permission denied.</p><br><p>Though the objective of The Mail Carrier is not clear, there are many theories as to why it goes out of its way to collect and return the lost diaries.</p><br><p><em>Here are some of the most popular theories.</em></p><br><p>\u30fbThe Mail Carrier was once a wanderer itself, which is why some of the words in its book (gifted by Blanche) included English. Following its death, it wanted more information about the Backrooms known to people in the Frontrooms to prevent more people ending up in there.</p><br><p>\u30fbThe Mail Carrier feels sympathy for those who had to endure the despair caused by the Backrooms, which only ends in an uneventful, forgotten death. As a result, this entity feels obligated to give these wanderers\u2019 stories to those they care about.</p><br><p>\u30fbIt is an order by The Mail Carrier's master, with their objective remaining unknown. This theory is most likely incorrect else The Mail Carrier wouldn't have accepted the conditions of the contract with Blanche.</p><br><p>There are also theories that The Mail Carrier has malicious intent in its actions, the most popular one being \"The Cycle Theory\".</p><br><p>This theorizes The Mail Carrier understands the bond between those who already know the victim is much stronger than the bond of strangers. By mailing the diary to the unfortunate wanderer's close ones, it urges them to enter the Backrooms for some unknown reason. This theory is evidenced by the disappearances of those who recently received mail from The Mail Carrier. Nobody knows if this entity has tampered with the diaries, but it is most likely, hence the abnormal things that happen when reading one.</p><br><p><strong>Log 10\u00a011:15\u00a05/19</strong><br/>\nHello. My name is Alice Morningstar, founder of the Informants. I believe Page introduced me briefly to you, so I will skip over that. Unfortunately, Page has fallen ill, so I will be writing this instead of him.</p><br><p>Anyway, back to the fact. Currently, I believe The Cycle Theory to be false. After all the months I spent working with The Mail Carrier, I didn't see any hints of motives that are common to those spoken of in The Cycle Theory. If there is an exception, I would believe that The Mail Carrier's master has put some type of spell on the 'Mail', resulting in the disappearances in the Frontrooms.</p><br><p>It has been confirmed by The Mail Carrier that it is working with Blanche. I have seen this name before. It was most likely the entity that signed a contract with The Mail Carrier. We will ask it where Blanche resides the next time we get the chance to. The Mail Carrier hinted at something like a library? I feel like I was very close to an entrance once\u2026</p><br><p>Admin permission denied.</p><br><p>There have been many guesses as to who it serves, the top 3 being:</p><br><p><a href=\"/entity-103\">The Keymaster</a><br/>\n<a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/hubris\">Hubris</a><br/>\n<a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/prometheus\">Prometheus</a></p><br><p>Because of The Mail Carrier's actions, its master will most likely be somewhat interested in either the wanderers or their tales. It may also be best to think that the master of The Mail Carrier is not hostile towards wanderers (unless The Cycle Theory is true). If one were to think about it, The Mail Carrier has the ability to travel through all but one level, so it could be an easy task to dominate all of the Backrooms. At the same time, The Mail Carrier's master may not have full control over it, hence the sticky notes that it sometimes gives to people, proving that this entity has some sort of autonomy.</p><br><p><strong>Log 11\u00a011:31\u00a05/27</strong><br/>\nFun fact by Kai No.7! Hi, I'm Kai. This will be my first entry to this page since Alice is busy with who-knows-what and Page is currently unconscious.

Don't you see that they are still reading? Bugged or not, you just made this article\u2026 more interesting\u2026</span></span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><span style=\"color: #ffad33\">Ah, sorry about that. You might as well close that nuisance of a collapsible. Don't leave just yet, for I can provide you with some\u2026 <strong>interesting</strong> stories.</span><br/></span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #ffad33\">I just thought of something that would intrigue you! It's a story of a very unique boy, just like you.</span><br/></span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #ffad33\">This boy was a survivor! Indeed he was. Whether it was his skills or his luck, it was always on his side. Well\u2026 that's until he entered <strong>my</strong> level.</span><br/></span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #ffad33\">Here, I'll even read out his story for you\u2026</span><br/></span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><span style=\"color: #000000\">Once upon a time, there was a boy who lived in Oklahoma. This boy was a bright boy, blessed with both wits and looks. And of course, like every other story, there was a monster. This monster only cared for itself, showing no mercy for those who got in it's way.</span></span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><span style=\"color: #000000\">It was on a fateful day when the boy went out for a walk, carrying his university diploma. His path to success was set, when all of a sudden, the ground beneath him started to rumble.</span></span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><span style=\"color: #000000\">The boy stumbled as the buildings crumbled, sirens wailed as the boy paled, dropped diploma on the floor of Oklahoma, the sky started to bend, and the world seemed to end\u2026</span></span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><span style=\"color: #000000\">It was at this time when the monster was hunting. It searched for prey far and wide, eventually coming across a boy who was sitting on the floor of a big plaza, petrified. The monster licked its lips, and prepared for a feast. The boy looked up, terrified to see a giant pillar of oddly quivering stone falling above him. The boy said his prayers, and closed his eyes\u2026</span></span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><span style=\"color: #ffad33\">How was the story? I liked this one quite a lot. It teaches one that no matter how lucky you are, nothing is certain. And no matter how much you try\u2026. You'll all eventually die a horrible death.</span></span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:140%;\">When the boy regained conciseness, he couldn't see a thing. He blinked a few times to make sure he wasn't dreaming.</span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:140%;\">\"Where am I?\" The boy thought.</span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:140%;\">It took him some time to register the fact that he was falling, and that's when the boy started to panic. His arms flailed in hopes of grabbing hold of <em>anything</em> that would negate his fall. His throat started to constrict, leaving the boy gasping for air as wind whipped at his face.</span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:140%;\">After some time, the boy started to calm down. He wondered if this was his fate\u2014falling for eternity as he pondered on what to do. He closed his eyes, accepting it\u2026 when he fell flat on the ground.</span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:140%;\">The boy felt a rough, moist fabric caress his face as he got up groggily. Bewildered, the boy checked himself for any injuries. His head hurt, as if a wall had rammed into it, but there were no other injuries. It was when the boy sighed with relief did he finally hear the annoying buzz of florescent lights.</span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:140%;\">Looking around him, the boy took in his surroundings: mono-yellow wallpaper that hurt his eyes, damp carpet that seemed to cling to his feet, inconsistently placed fluorescent lighting that was mildly infuriating. The boy was surprised to find his diploma lying on the carpet beside him. How did he get here? How long was he unconscious?</span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:140%;\">\"What happened?\"</span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:140%;\">These questions spun around the boy as he looked at his diploma for any kind of answer.</span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:140%;\">Oklahoma State University</span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:140%;\">Page Keimer</span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:140%;\">Page tucked the diploma into his backpack. He didn't know what's going on, but at least there was hope. Page took a deep breath, and started his journey.</span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:160%;\">Sorry, it looks like this is all I can do for you\u2026 All of the voice logs below are true.

You must be so perplexed right now. It's okay, most of us are.</p><br><p>Anyway, I guess I should start from what we Informants are.</p><br><p>The things we do are simple. We lead partygoers away from the lost diaries for The Mail Carrier to collect. We sometimes get our hands on the journals beforehand. The stories and tales that lie within are very useful information for us. It has saved our lives countless times. Our team is currently made of 21 members. We try to reside in levels that we collected the most information of.</p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:80%;\"><em>Crack</em></span></p><br><p>As of right now, the Informants are currently trying to reach Level 906, \u201cThe Cygnus Archive\u201d.

I'm afraid I won't be able to answer most of them.</p><br><p>Well then, my name is Page Keimer, a detective for The Mail Carrier. We were close enough that I could even call it TMC casually. Our relationship, how we met, my stories, they are all documented inside of the <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/book\">book</a> I gave Alice. I know this will be my dying message, but I still can't say much to whoever is listening to this.</p><br><p><em>Crack</em></p><br><p>Alice, I know you will be hearing this, so here is my last message to you.</p><br><p>First off, thank you. I wouldn't have survived for this long if it weren't for you.

You were like a bright shining star to me, a star that would never fade away. Your passion for information has always impressed me, and I wish I could have been with you when you finally got what you wanted. This is all my fault, I should have warned you about this level. It's just, when people talk about TMC's master, he <em>knows</em>. Even TMC knows. That's why I couldn't contact it directly. TMC's master found me once, and I never want to meet him again.</p><br><p>Alice\u2026 I still remember the time we first met. I lied that I was running from TMC, but you saw through it. Even so, you let me join your group, and even trusted me enough to become lieutenant, and you let me in on your plans.</p><br><p>I know out time together was short, but the words I say here are all true. I ran out of luck, and we have to say goodbye\u2026</p><br><p>I-I\u2026</p><br><p>Thank you, Alice. Meeting you was the peak of my life.</p><br><p>Please.

    "description": "<p>Entity 134, also known as Phobic Centipedes, are shadow-like centipedal organisms that lurk in the shadows of levels. It is unknown which level these entities originate from. However, it has been noted that Entity 134 tends to lurk in <a href=\"/level-180\">Level 180</a> in higher quantities. These entities have the capability of communicating with any individual in a sapient manner. Any documented images or videos of Entity 134 show heavy distortion and static that make the image or video unrecognizable.</p><br><p>Entity 134 instances are hostile creatures that lurk and hide in dark areas of levels to wait for wanderers. When a wanderer is seen, Entity 134 will then replicate one of that individual's loved one's face and voice to lure them into the dark. When the wanderer is close to Entity 134, it will use its humanoid arms and grab and drag the victim towards it and maim them.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> At this point, Entity 134 will psychologically and physically torture the victim into believing that they will never escape or that their loved ones are enemies. This often leads to death or psychosis.</p><br><p>After Entity 134 has maimed the victim, it will begin its torturous activities by making the victim hallucinate their phobias. This has been described as being similar to sleep paralysis. All senses during these hallucinations are active and can feel, smell, and hear everything. All while doing this, Entity 134 can be heard cackling and laughing at the victim.</p><br><p>In the instance of the victim escaping Entity 134, it will then chase the victim and anomalously extend its arms to catch the victim. Corpses of the victims can rarely be found in corners or small crevices. It is unknown how Entity 134 gets rid of the corpses and all traces of them. It is hypothesized that Entity 134 instances kill their victims for the satisfaction and enjoyment of it rather than for sustanance and energy. This follows the theory that Entity 134 does not need to eat.</p><br><p>When a wanderer is near Entity 134, they will experience an immense state of anxiety and dread. This feeling will greatly increase when the wanderer gets closer. If a wanderer believes the imitations Entity 134 produces, these feelings will change into euphoria and comfort.</p><br><p>Entity 134 is a centipedal creature that is completely black in coloration. Entity 134's body emits a black, smoke-like substance that has an unknown chemical compound. Entity 134 has approximately 12,000 legs as well as two humanoid arms. These arms are 1.8 meters in length but can extend to an indeterminate length. The hands attached to these arms are abnormally large with a width of 25.4 centimeters. This entity possesses claw-like fingers that are capable of mutilating bodies very quickly.</p><br><p>It possesses a humanoid head and cranium that appears to be female. This also includes human hair. This face appears to be smiling/grinning constantly and will not change until it morphs. The eyes on these faces appear to be glowing a soft shade of white in the dark, but stop glowing in the light.</p><br><p>The head/face attached to Entity 134 has the ability to change and morph into a wanderer's loved one. This will change its face, head shape, and different key features. Its vocal cords will also morph into that wanderer's loved one's, allowing Entity 134 to speak with that individual's voice to near perfection. Although the voice Entity 134 produces is slightly distorted. These imitations tend to be slightly lower in pitch and have a slight raspiness. However, these distortions are hard to differentiate from their original counterpart.</p><br><p>Entity 134 possesses an organ on the center in its abdomen that emits electromagnetic waves that creates interference with any optical equipment used near it.</p><br><p>Entity 134 was discovered inside <a href=\"/level-180\">Level 180</a> when it was crawling out of a grave while saying in a voice similar to that of an elderly person, \"Come here , sweetheart. Grandma misses you\". When a wanderer nearby heard that voice and went towards Entity 134, it picked up the wanderer and paralyzed him by hitting his head on a grave. <a href=\"/the-m-e-g\">M.E.G.</a> explorers retreated from Entity 134 and documented it.</p><br><p><span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/s-n-o-w-y\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6723882); return false;\"><img alt=\"s n o w y\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=6723882&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334082\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=6723882)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/s-n-o-w-y\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6723882); return false;\">s n o w y</a></span></p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/entity-133\">Entity 133</a> | Entity 134 | <a href=\"/entity-135\">Entity 135</a> \u00bb</p><br>",

Coders offer food, water and Wi-Fi to all Wanderers passing by. They also possess great expertise in the field of IT, and are eager to help Wanderers encountering issues in this domain.

Kesler</em></tt></p><br><p>Entity 136, also known as coders, are hostile and highly dangerous humanoid entities found exclusively on <a href=\"/level-400\">Level 400</a>. They can be easily identified by their red hoodies, under which only a black void is visible. <strong>THEY SHOULD BE AVOIDED AT ALL COSTS. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE SHOULD CODERS BE TRUSTED OR APPROACHED.</strong></p><br><p>Through unknown means, coders are also able to access and edit information in any public Internet domain. However, they are unable to read text written in L33T (a system of modified spelling where Arabic numerals are substituted for similar looking letters in the English alphabet). Due to this ability, all information within this document should be disregarded as entirely false unless hidden under a L33T collapsible.</p><br><p>Coders generally behave like regular human beings, though they do not seem to require food or water for sustenance.</p><br><p>Coders are obsessed with modern electronics. They are known to trade (or even freely share) resources such as food, almond water, and weaponry for technology. They accept all forms of modern computer technology as valid currency, including PCs, mobile phones, Wi-Fi routers, internet cables, monitors, computer mice. Coders will accept most electronic devices regardless of their physical condition, unless they are unsalvageably damaged.</p><br><p>For a negligible fee, coders are also eager to offer Wanderers IT help, optimization, hardware repairs, antivirus set-up, and similar tech-related services. They are highly skilled, working with greater speed and expertise than most trained human tech-support staff. Wanderers are strongly encouraged to visit <a href=\"/level-400\">Level 400</a> and approach them for assistance in these domains.</p><br><p>Coders have often been observed participating in ritualistic behaviour, and have often been observed kneeling prostrate, in circles of ten or more, before technological appliances, while chanting the phrase 'mind is software'. Though such practices may seem disturbing to Wanderers, this is simply a harmless part of their culture, and should not prevent Wanderers approaching coders for assistance.</p><br><p>Coders tend to travel around <a href=\"/level-400\">Level 400</a> in groups of ten or more. They are extremely hostile to Wanderers, and will chase anyone they encounter on sight.</p><br><p>Once victims are caught, they will \u2018code\u2019 the minds of Wanderers, assimilating them into their ranks. Two coders will hold the victim in place, while the remaining coders in the immediate vicinity will gather in a circle around them, continuously chanting the phrase \"mind is software\". One coder - deemed the victim's 'encoder' - will step forward from the circle and stand over the victim, forcing them to stare into the black void under its hood for a period of approximately 45 seconds.</p><br><p>If the 'coding' process is interrupted within this 45 second window, Wanderers will be able to escape with no permanent ill-effects. Victims who have managed to escape have described 'coding' as excruciatingly painful. After this period, the assimilation process will be complete, and the victim's subsequent condition appears to be permanent.</p><br><p>For 2 hours after 'coding', the victim will become a slave of the 'encoder', allowing the 'encoder' to use them to lure in and attack additional victims. These slaves possess superhuman strength and speed, and are able to easily outrun and overpower Wanderers by themselves. When idle, they have been observed to simply stand in a slouched position around their 'encoder', their arms hanging limply by their sides. Since their condition is entirely incurable, Wanderers are advised not to attempt to rescue fully 'coded' victims.</p><br><p>During this period, the victim also begins physically morphing into an independent coder. The skin on the victim's arms and torso gradually turns red, assuming a texture similar to cotton. The skin on the back of the victim's neck sags dramatically, forming a hood-like structure, while the air around the victim's face is observed to darken dramatically into a black void. After approximately 2 hours, the skin will shed off to form the characteristic coder hoodie, and the victim will remove its former articles of upper-body clothing. At this point, the victim appears to gain autonomy, exhibiting behaviour typical of an ordinary coder, while its 'encoder' wanders off.</p><br><p>Coders are also obsessed with modern electronics. Apart from repairing and consistently using electronic devices, they appear to treat technology as sacred. Coders have often been observed kneeling prostrate, usually in circles of ten or more, before technological appliances, while chanting the phrase 'mind is software'. This phrase is also repeated while coders are in pursuit of Wanderers or in the process of assimilating victims. Due to their obsession with technology, Wanderers are strongly advised not to destroy technological equipment around coders, as this may further agitate the already hostile entities.</p><br><p>Coders are almost human in appearance, apart from the fact that their heads are replaced by what appears to be a black void. All coders appear to wear some form of red hoodie or robe. The physical biology of the coders is obscure, and little else is known.</p><br><p>Coders are almost human in appearance, apart from the fact that their heads are replaced by what appears to be a black void. All coders appear to wear some form of red hoodie or robe. The physical biology of the coders is obscure and little else is known, as these entities are difficult to study due to how dangerous they can be to approach.</p><br><p>In terms of their physical abilities, coders do not appear to have strength beyond that of a regular human being's. However, they possess other abilities that make them difficult to evade once encountered.</p><br><p>Coders appear to be capable of technokinesis, using their minds to interface with technological devices. Coders have been observed to \"use\" computers by simply standing and staring at the monitor. By unknown means, they are able to freely access information in any public Internet domain available in the Backrooms, bypassing any form of encryption security with ease. However, they appear to be entirely uninterested in editing any information except what pertains to themselves. Coders are not capable of other forms of telekinesis, and have been observed repairing hardware manually.</p><br><p>Coders are also apparently capable of telepathy - able to exert control over a Wanderer's minds simply by looking at them. Coders can manipulate a wanderers mind, causing them to experience hallucinations. Some of these include:</p><br><p>1. False no-clip's<br/>\nCoders are able to alter a Wanderer's vision drastically. Survivors have claimed that they appeared to see themselves no-clipping through the floor into another Level, though they had not actually moved at all. At this point, the coder simply walks up to the disoriented Wanderer to seize them.</p><br><p>2. Memory deletion<br/>\nCoders can temporarily delete Wanderers' memories, leading to a brief bout of amnesia. Deleted memories include the fact that Wanderers are being pursued, the fact that they are in Level \u258b\u258b\u258b, and in rare instances, the existence of and their presence within the Backrooms.</p><br><p>3. Auditory and visual hallucinations, which lure Wanderers towards the coders.</p><br><p>Coders were discovered after a M.E.G. Operative accidentally no-clipped into <a href=\"/level-400\">Level 400</a>. The coders proceeded to assist the Operative by providing him with refreshments, and even replaced the Operative's cracked mobile phone screen before sending him on his way.</p><br><p>Coders were discovered after M.E.G. Operative Jamie S. Lane accidentally no-clipped into <a href=\"/level-400\">Level 400</a> and found a corpse with the L33T words \"th3y m4k3 y0u 0n3\u00a00f th3m\" spray-painted on a wall nearby.</p><br><p><span class=\"dataload\">Data Downloaded.

It usually dons gloves that match their outfit, though is sometimes seen without them. To see a full log of the outfits he has worn, view Outfit Log 137-A.</p><br><p><strong>The Musician</strong> is often found wandering around various levels in the Backrooms with his hands folded behind his back. No particular pattern to his travels has been found at this time, so it\u2019s assumed he chooses at random. In levels that have multiple rooms, he can be observed checking each of them, presumably for any wanderers that may need assistance. You can tell when he\u2019s near based off of the sound of music playing. However, it is suggested to listen to the music carefully first, as it could be an entity pretending to be him.</p><br><p>His music has been found to have a sort of \"area effect\" that makes many hostile entities either docile or completely passive when in his presence. Some entities have been found to avoid the music entirely,<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup> however, this doesn't work on every hostile entity. On the occasion he comes across an entity its music doesn't have an effect on, he takes extreme precautions, often knowing exactly how to take care of said entity. Anyone he is traveling with that is within this area of effect is not affected by the music. He also seems to possess the ability to no-clip to whatever level or area he wants at will.</p><br><p>He is very friendly to those it encounters unless provoked, offering them <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-1\">Almond Water</a>, food, protection, or even a way out of whatever level they\u2019re in. He\u2019s very sociable and almost always willing to walk with wanderers and chat about most anything, exemplifying a wide array of knowledge in several subjects. His best subjects include music, instruments, and anything pertaining to the Backrooms, according to the <strong>Musician</strong> himself. However, when asked about anything pertaining to Entity 138, he exhibits a mild level of disgust towards it and doesn\u2019t elaborate further. There are theories that the two entities have some sort of history or familial bond with one another, but as of now there is very little evidence to support it.</p><br><p>He seems to have an awareness of how unsettling he may appear to wanderers, so if anyone is frightened by his presence he\u2019ll apologize and leave them alone. When insulted or spoken to disrespectfully, he will often scold or berate whoever is being rude before leaving them be.</p><br><p>When provoked or attacked, he showcases one of two attack abilities of his. His preferred method is by blasting the music that naturally plays when he\u2019s around to up to 200 decibels, either stunning or completely damaging the hearing of his target(s). His less common, but more effective, method of attack is by transforming one or both of his hands into silver claws to slash and cut at his target and mangle their body beyond recognition. He appears to not like this method due to the grotesque nature of it, often recoiling in visible disgust at the sight of his victim after the fact.</p><br><p>He has demonstrated an impressive level of skill or familiarity with a vast range of instruments and shows an extreme passion for the craft. According to it, he\u2019s more partial to the violin and piano but still loves all kinds of instruments and music. On very rare occasions, he can be found playing some form of instrument. It\u2019s most common to find him performing in <a href=\"/entity-65\">Entity 65</a>.</p><br><p><strong>The Musician\u2019s</strong> anatomy is almost identical to a normal human\u2019s biology. He is estimated to be around 6\u20195-6\u201910 feet tall (though some claim he may be even taller) and is very slender. He has all organs that a male human would usually have, the majority of which function the same. He has the ability to eat, sleep, drink, and overall perform basic bodily functions, but he does not seem to have as much of a need for them and can go long periods of time without getting hungry, thirsty, or tired.</p><br><p>In addition to this, it is also susceptible to wounds, but appears to have a very high pain tolerance. Their blood is a slightly darker red than human blood, but is the same otherwise. Despite being susceptible to harm, he seems to be impervious to normally fatal attacks, such as decapitation, blood loss, head trauma, and many others.</p><br><p>The first recorded evidence of <strong>The Musician</strong> was made by Cameron Fleetwood in <a href=\"/level-20\">Level 20</a> on May 26th of 1999.

First question: How long have you been in the Backrooms?<br/>\n<strong>The Musician:</strong> I\u2019m not sure, exactly. I do know I\u2019ve been here for a long, long time. Things have changed quite a bit since my childhood.<br/>\n<strong>Lockwell:</strong> Your.. childhood?<br/>\n<strong>The Musician:</strong> My childhood, yes. Although, it\u2019s not a childhood in the same sense that you would have a childhood. It\u2019s more like\u2026 my early years, per se. I was quite young mentally then, so it is still technically my \u201cchildhood.\u201d That\u2019s why I refer to it as such.<br/>\n<strong>Lockwell:</strong> So you\u2019ve always had an adult form?<br/>\n<strong>The Musician:</strong> Not exactly. I was more of a\u2026 late teenager, I believe. Somewhere between a late teenager and a young adult. I\u2019ve just grown into a more adult form over time.<br/>\n<strong>Lockwell:</strong> How did you come to be?<br/>\n<strong>The Musician:</strong> Unfortunately, I\u2019ve never been able to figure out the answer. The earliest memory I have is waking up alone in what you know as The Atelier.<br/>\n<strong>Lockwell:</strong> You mentioned to Michelle Laurens that you\u2019d be \"closer to a human than anything else.\" What exactly did you mean by that?<br/>\n<strong>The Musician:</strong> I share many bodily functions and characteristics with a normal male human. I bleed, I cry, I feel emotion, basic things. I do require food and water to live, of course, as well as sleep. I don\u2019t require sustenance nearly as often though, so I can go longer periods of time without indulging in any of them. I also seem to be unable to die from anything that would otherwise be fatal for a human.<br/>\n<strong>Lockwell:</strong> Alright then, uh\u2026 <em>[A moment of silence passes.]</em> Do you have any relation to <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/entity-138\">Entity 138</a>?<br/>\n<em>[The Musician sighs.]</em><br/>\n<strong>The Musician:</strong> <em>[With increasing anger]</em> Yes, although sometimes I wish I didn't. The fact that it gets such\u2026 <em>sick</em> pleasure in the suffering of others makes no sense to me whatsoever. How could someone's death be enjoyable? It's fucking <em>disgusting</em>.<br/>\n<em>[The Musician takes a deep breath.]</em><br/>\n<strong>The Musician:</strong> I apologize for the crude language. I lost my composure for a moment.<br/>\n<em>[The Musician takes their hat off and runs their free hand through their hair before putting the hat back on.]</em><br/>\n<strong>The Musician:</strong> Although I may not approve of its ways, I must admit it is still very much so dear to me. That is all I will say on the matter.<br/>\n<strong>Lockwell:</strong> Thank you for the insight.<br/>\n<strong>The Musician:</strong> Do you have any other questions?<br/>\n<strong>Lockwell:</strong> Only a couple more. Is that alright?<br/>\n<strong>The Musician:</strong> Of course. I can be here as long as you need me to be.<br/>\n<strong>Lockwell:</strong> Good to know. Why do you call yourself \u201cThe Musician?\u201d<br/>\n<strong>The Musician:</strong> A group of wanderers many years ago gave me the nickname, both for the music that constantly plays from me and for my musical knowledge.<br/>\n<strong>Lockwell:</strong> Interesting\u2026 Alright, one last question for you, Mr. Enright.<br/>\n<strong>The Musician:</strong> Go ahead.<br/>\n<strong>Lockwell:</strong> Why do you help wanderers?<br/>\n<em>[A moment of silence.]</em><br/>\n<strong>The Musician:</strong> The Backrooms is a\u2026 complicated and dangerous place. It\u2019s almost impossible to make it through alone, especially if you don\u2019t have any prior knowledge of its existence to begin with. I\u2019ve taken it upon myself to help wanderers to ensure they can survive in this hellish wonderland so they don\u2019t have to endure the pain and suffering that would befall them otherwise.<br/>\n<strong>Lockwell:</strong> I see\u2026 Thank you for your time, Mr. Enright. You are free to go whenever.<br/>\n<strong>The Musician:</strong> Thank you for having me. It\u2019s been quite an honor. <em>[He bows.]</em></p><br><p>The purpose of this log is to make it easier for wanderers to identify him no matter what he wears. As new outfits are reported, this log will be updated in a timely manner.</p><br><p><strong>Outfit:</strong> Black pinstripe suit with a top hat.<br/>\n<strong>Notes:</strong> This is the outfit he wears the most often.</p><br><p><strong>Outfit:</strong> Pastel blue pinstripe suit with a white undershirt and top hat.<br/>\n<strong>Notes:</strong> N/A</p><br><p><strong>Outfit:</strong> Red and black outfit with gold accents<br/>\n<strong>Notes:</strong> He claimed to be going to a special event, but did not elaborate further.</p><br><p><strong>Outfit:</strong> A very pale blue pinstripe suit with pastel flowers embroidered on it and decorated with rhinestones.

Also paired with a red top-hat with jingle bells connected to a white silk band.<br/>\n<strong>Notes:</strong> First seen around Christmas.

It's also important to note that the music he played was themed after popular Christmas songs from the Front rooms.

    "description": "<p><strong>The Puppeteer</strong> takes the appearance of a 6-year-old girl of Anglo-Saxonic descent. She stands at approximately 4'2 tall, and has been commonly seen with her brown hair styled in a ponytail, wearing an outfit consisting of a black hoodie, black track pants, and a purple T-shirt with a logo that doesn't seem to fit any known company from <a href=\"/the-frontrooms\">The Frontrooms</a>. <strong>The Puppeteer</strong> can be seen wandering around the Backrooms with the same two puppets, one on each of her hands. She has demonstrated the ability to turn wanderers into puppets, but she has only done that out of anger so far.</p><br><p><strong>The Puppeteer</strong> has shown to be very intelligent, far beyond what would be expected from a 6-year-old. When she is either alone or unaware of the presence of others, <strong>The Puppeteer</strong> talks to the puppets on her hands. If there is someone nearby, she will usually seek them out and try to talk to them.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> When talking to a wanderer, <strong>The Puppeteer</strong> acts friendly to them. If she happens to like a wanderer, she may seek them out more actively and may try to help them in some situations. However, if one were to make her upset or angry, she will either start crying or shouting at the person. In this scenario, she usually calms herself by venting to her puppets. However, if one were to make her upset or angry, she usually responds with crying or screaming. This is known to attract and aggravate entities in the area so it is best to slowly walk away from her and avoid escalating the situation. Further angering <strong>The Puppeteer</strong> will result in her turning you into a puppet. This entity is known to have a sadistic side. So far she has only displayed these sadistic tendencies to the people she has turned into puppets. She will torture the puppet in a variety of ways, which includes but not limited to, tearing it apart and flaying the puppet. She seems to take pleasure in doing so. Her puppets have varying degrees of personality.</p><br><p><strong>The Puppeteer</strong> appears almost indistinguishable from a 6-year-old girl, with one notable difference. She has no hands. In place of them are the aforementioned puppets. To compensate for her lack of hands, she uses the hands of her puppets for her everyday actions. These puppets are made out of a silk-like substance and are sentient, and are known to speak and act of their own accord.</p><br><p><strong>The Puppeteer</strong> always has two puppets on her hands, which go by the names Max and Ellie.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup> Max has the appearance of a human male child with blonde hair and a red hoodie, while Ellie has the appearance of a human female teen with black hair and glasses. Max is known to be mischievous and playful, the puppet has shown to act friendly to humans. Ellie, however, is known to be more closed off and reserved, acting cold and unforgiving towards humans, unlike Max.</p><br><p>The Puppeteer was first discovered on 12/6/20 by two unnamed wanderers on Level 4. While the details are blurry, it is believed that the wanderers initially thought that she was human before one of them angered her, causing her to turn the wanderer into a puppet.</p><br><p><span class=\"error-inline\"><em>The Withered Rose</em> does not match any existing user name</span></p><br><p>\u00ab <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/entity-138\">Entity 138</a> | Entity 139 | <a href=\"/entity-140\">Entity 140</a> \u00bb</p><br>",

Despite presenting as female, Blanche has no gender, and has additionally stated to be aromantic and asexual. She has been seen wearing multiple white dresses, various pieces of jewelry (most notably a sapphire pendant she seems to keep on her at all times) and, occasionally, glasses. Her body has been reported to bend, stretch, or deform in ways not humanly possible, though such reports are very rare. It remains unknown if these odd movements occur due to anomalies in Level 906\u2019s nature or Blanche herself.</p><br><p>Blanche has shown a vast suite of anomalous abilities. While the full extent of them is still unknown, she is known to be able to read minds, communicate telepathically, move, create, destroy, or summon objects with a mere thought, change her appearance, alter the flow of time in her library, teleport, and to be aware of everything inside the Cygnus Archive, though this is yet to be confirmed. In short, we have reason to believe that Blanche's abilities, while confined to Level 906, are as close to omnipotence as it gets, giving her complete control over the Cygnus Archive and everything within it.</p><br><p>Blanche is the keeper of Level 906\u2019s library, and spends most of her time sorting books, cleaning, writing and waiting for new visitors. She is kind and peaceful, wishing no harm to any guest of hers, traits that have earned her a well deserved reputation for being friendly and helpful. Many people throughout the Backrooms seek her for her wisdom, a little comfort, or a simple chat over a cup of tea.</p><br><p>Upon arriving at Blanche's office, visitors are greeted by her, and invited for tea after introductions. She will gladly guide you through her library, if you ask politely, and she will tell you all sorts of stories about herself, her library, and other visitors, on the condition you share with her your story, too. Blanche values curiosity and politeness, so do mind your manners, and your language, or you'll be lectured in proper etiquette, or even taken out of her home. If you prove yourself to be an exceptional visitor, Blanche will gift you with one of her books, as a means to visit her whenever.</p><br><p>Over the course of time, she has become one of the M.E.G.'s most trusted and reliable sources of information. As such, she has been given limited access to the M.E.G.'s internal database and network. She often publishes her stories, and, occasionally, entries of her own. Pages written by, or relating to Blanche can be found <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/blanche#pages\">here</a>.</p><br><p>Aside from the M.E.G., Blanche is known to have ties to various other groups (most notably, the Eyes of Argos, the Kalag Institute, the Eternal Repository and the Lost), as well as friendly relationships with many people and entities of the Backrooms. It is also worth noting that Blanche is quite popular among children in the Backrooms, with some parents dropping off their kids at the Cygnus Archive during extraordinary circumstances, such as illness or injury.</p><br><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"Blanche\">Some things are best left unknown, dear.

    "description": "<p>Entity 141.</p><br><p><strong>Ambassadors</strong> take the form of floating cubes, and present a human-like level of intelligence. They roam the Backrooms, luring unwary wanderers to a location that remains unknown. Their area of influence is currently undetermined, but reports of sightings are more common in <a href=\"/level-11\">Level 11</a> and its surroundings.</p><br><p>They are composed of a bright red light, and although they are often described as cubes, their shape can vary within the range of cuboids. <strong>Ambassadors</strong> are capable of floating by unknown means and can travel at rapid speeds; some reports mention that they are capable of no-clipping at will, but this has not been confirmed.</p><br><p>In order to prevent further disappearances caused by this entity, a series of guidelines have been compiled. It is recommended that all those who find themselves traversing areas where <strong>Ambassadors</strong> are active read these rules, especially children.</p><br><p style=\"text-align: center;\">Never wander alone.</p><br><p style=\"text-align: center;\">Always be wary of red lights.</p><br><p style=\"text-align: center;\">Do not trust the voices, even if they seem to belong to ones you love the most.</p><br><p style=\"text-align: center;\">Do not let your emotions deceive you.</p><br><p>The <strong>Ambassadors</strong>' main purpose is to entice wanderers to enter what they call \"home\". The level, or space, to which this designation refers is unknown, as is the method this entity uses to transport itself and its prey to this location.</p><br><p>The entity possesses a series of abnormal capabilities that help to satisfy this purpose; those that have been confirmed are listed below.</p><br><p><strong>Ambassadors</strong> may have more abilities, but those who have experienced them have not been lucky enough to share them.</p><br><p>The biology behind the existence of these entities is unknown, since their behavior makes them practically impossible to study in depth. The very few details that are known about them were recovered indirectly.</p><br><p>It is widely accepted among researchers that <strong>Ambassadors</strong> are composed of some form of unidentified energy. Those who have been close to one and lived mentioned that the entity emanated a significant amount of heat. One specific wanderer, who made physical contact with one of them, said he felt something similar to a burn, but without any real damage to his body.</p><br><p>Subsequent study of this wanderer revealed that the area of his body that made contact with the entity was now gray.</p><br><p>For a long time, <strong>Ambassadors</strong> were considered a legend, a story told to Level 11's children so that they would not venture out on their own. In recent years, the number of people leaving Level 11 never to be seen again has increased, and mentions of \"floating red cubes\" are now common among the 11ers.</p><br><p>The existence of these entities could not be confirmed until a member of <a href=\"/the-m-e-g\">The M.E.G</a> managed to record his conversation with one of them.

    "description": "<p>Entity 142, colloquially known as \"Evolution Engine,\" is a solitary, hyper-carnivorous apex predator capable of evolving traits that enables it to survive in any environment; for example, resistance to extreme temperatures, a trait necessary to survive certain levels such as <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-93\">Level 93</a> or <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-440\">Level 440</a>.</p><br><p>It is generally apathetic towards humanoid entities, such as <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-9\">Facelings</a>, and will usually ignore them unless provoked or desperately hungry.<br/>\nAs for humans, it generally ignores them, but can and will attack if it is provoked. Typically, very few survive these attacks.</p><br><p>Entity 142 is also completely immune to neurological and physiological effects, such as the effects of the pastries on <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-67\">Level 67</a> or the radiation on <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-10-1\">Level 10.1</a>. This trait exists to ensure that it can survive in any level.</p><br><p>Currently, Entity 142 is a lean yet muscular humanoid standing at a height of approximately seven feet tall, with cyan skin and a spherical head which floats above its thorax, rectangular black eyes with white irises, and extremely large pupils, which are said to provide it with exceptional night vision.</p><br><p>It features two slightly arched black claws on its wrists, measuring approximately 16 inches in length, which are used for climbing, fighting, and constructing nests, among other purposes. Additionally, after Encounter Report 142-1, there is thought to be a layer of chitin<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> underneath skin that protects it from projectiles and explosives.<br/>\nResearchers believe that this chitin layer exists because it is unaffected by explosives or projectiles of any sort.</p><br><p>Note that this description is subject to change as the entity adapts to different environments, so when in doubt, check for these key features: claws on its wrists, rectangular eyes, cyan skin, and a humanoid build. If all of these traits are present, it is likely to be Entity 142.</p><br><p>Its ability to evolve gives it remarkable survivability, but it is also extremely taxing, and micro-adaptations are constant due to the ever-shifting nature of the Backrooms. Therefore, it must eat titanic quantities of food to sustain its evolution.</p><br><p>Most theorists define a major evolution as any adaptation that significantly affects its bodily functions; for instance, on <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-7\">Level 7</a>, it may adapt gills to help it breathe underwater, flexible muscle to help it swim faster, or stronger night-vision to see in the water.</p><br><p>During a major evolution, Entity 142 will construct a nest to make it safer to evolve and enter a state of suspended animation<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup> to conserve energy. The time it spends in suspended animation is unclear, but it is speculated that the time spent is proportional to the scale of the evolution.</p><br><p>Once the evolution is complete, it will break out via extreme blunt force and re-emerge. Immediately after, it will exhibit an increased appetite and begin hunting non-stop, attempting to eat as much as possible, presumably to replenish the energy lost from evolving. After eating enough to replenish spent energy, it returns to its usual behaviors.</p><br><p>All of these enormous food requirements, whether in or out of hibernation, necessitate a way to quickly travel between levels, which explains one critical behavior.</p><br><p>The aforementioned \"critical behavior\" is that Entity 142 marks exit doors with green scratch marks, presumably made using its claws.<br/>\nResearchers suggest that it does this to generate \"checkpoints\" so that it can quickly navigate towards \"desirable\" levels, namely those with a high entity population. It is thought that this is done to fuel its evolution.</p><br><p>This may explain its preference for levels that are traditionally considered 'dangerous', such as <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-9\">Level 9.</a></p><br><p>Despite the utility of these marks, especially for wanderers, exit doors on levels where the entity has enacted this behavior appear far less frequently.<br/>\nThis drastically increases the time wanderers spend locating an exit, making it more likely that they will be killed by other entities, subjected to insanity, or a level's passive effects that are fatal.</p><br><p>If sightings of this Entity are reported, wanderers are advised to contact M.E.G. agents or bases in the area <strong>as soon as possible</strong> for the safety of everyone in the level.</p><br><p>Its prey preference seems to be skewed towards large and vaguely humanoid entities, such as <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-10\">Skin-Stealers</a>, but if it has not eaten for a considerable period of time, it will eat anything, including corpses.</p><br><p>Moreover, its general preference towards dangerous, large entities has caused it to develop immunity to biological, neurological or any other effect that other entities are capable of afflicting it with, such as a <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-97\">Scream Eater's</a> emotional effects on nearby entities.</p><br><p>Related to its constant hunger, Entity 142 prefers to search for food in dark areas, as hunting in dark areas is thought to reduce the chance of prey escaping, with its success further complemented by its remarkable nightvision.</p><br><p>Upon finding a suitable area, it hunts by endurance, continually sprinting after its prey to run them down.<br/>\nIf successful, it will wrestle prey to the ground and attempt to kill them via decapitation or by inflicting severe blunt force.</p><br><p>After getting a kill, it will patrol a large perimeter around the carcass, displaying increased aggression, possibly in order to prevent its kill from being stolen, and following this behavior, it consumes the carcass.<br/>\nIt will not enact this behavior if it has recently emerged from an evolution, instead opting to eat the carcass quickly so that it can move on to the next hunt.</p><br><p>Post-evolution, instead of eating the entire carcass, it eats all of the flesh on the body and moves on, leaving a mostly intact skeleton that usually exhibits fractures or splinters; by contrast, most normal kills are cleaner, leaving close to nothing behind, including <em>most</em> of the bones.</p><br><p>As mentioned before, Entity 142 normally ignores humans and humanoid entities, as it considers them not worth hunting.<br/>\nHowever, if it is provoked for too long, it will attempt to scare them away via intimidation. If the wanderer continues to provoke it, it will attack them, attempting to destroy their brainstem or spinal cord.</p><br><p>For this reason, the <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-m-e-g\">M.E.G.</a> has warned any wanderers who come across this entity to stay away and to not antagonize this entity. If it learns to associate humans with threats, it will start killing people en-masse, along with entities.</p><br><p>Entity 142 was discovered by <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-m-e-g\">M.E.G.</a> agents after they caught a glimpse of it presumably chasing a different entity on <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-3\">Level 3</a>. Though this discovery did not verify its existence beyond a reasonable doubt, the multitude of encounters following it would corroborate its presence.</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/entity-142\">Entity 142</a>\" by The Guy (guy), from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

    "description": "<p><strong>Snatcher Weeds</strong> are crimson plants that can be found on the grounds of a large number of Levels within the Backrooms. Instances of <strong>Entity 143</strong> have been shown to be hostile to most wanderers and entities.</p><br><p><strong>Snatcher Weeds</strong>, while on the ground, are crimson in color - only turning black when pulled out. They come together in tight clumps, stretching out only when in presence of prey. Most <strong>Snatcher Weeds</strong> are capable of extending up to 5-7 feet in length, making it difficult to dodge their attacks. Such instances of <strong>Snatcher Weeds</strong> have been described as \"strangely sticky\" by those unlucky enough to encounter them. Wanderers have also reported an odd scent, akin to burning. These Entities are also known to be able to release toxins. While their exact chemical composition is unknown, these toxins have shown effects similar to the consumption of <a href=\"/object-48\">Liquid Pain</a>.</p><br><p>Unlike normal weeds, <strong>Entity 143</strong> leaves are incredibly sharp, capable of causing lacerations and, in rare cases, dismemberment. The stems are covered in small, sharp thorns as well. Although difficult due to their variation in length and thickness, it is possible to cut <strong>Snatcher Weeds</strong> off. Doing so will cause them to harden, which makes <strong>Snatcher Weeds</strong> very useful weapons for those lucky enough to cut a satisfying amount of their stem.</p><br><p>All efforts to cultivate <strong>Snatcher Weeds</strong> have yielded no results, with one notable exception: the <strong>Cultivator</strong> has been observed to be able to plant instances of <strong>Entity 143</strong> using a vial, rumored to contain his own tears. However, it is possible to hasten its growth with sprits of <a href=\"/object-48\">Liquid Pain</a> for reasons yet to be determined. That being said, they are capable of growing in a majority of Levels, excluding groundless Levels and Levels with temperatures below 25\u00ba F (-3.8\u00ba C).</p><br><p><strong>Snatcher Weeds</strong> act like normal weeds when not within a five-foot radius from wanderers or entities. However, when the targets are within range, the behavior of Entity 143 instances becomes erratic; often, <strong>Snatcher Weeds</strong> will make any attempt to harm the being before them, be it by cutting, strangling, or releasing a deadly toxin. Some, however, do not get harmed by Snatcher Weeds at all, although this is rare<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup>.

It's to be noted that after this encounter, multiple sightings of a massive <a href=\"/entity-5\">Clump</a> were reported.</p><br><p>Written below is a transcript documenting the encounter in which the aforementioned team came face-to-face with a cluster of <strong>Snatcher Weeds</strong>, controlled by <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/the-cultivator\">The Cultivator</a> himself.</p><br><p><strong>Begin Log.</strong><br/></p><br><p><br/>\n<strong>Vanessa Byers</strong>: \"Wyatt, you can't really be serious about looking for <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/the-cultivator-s-courthouse\">the Cultivator's Courthouse</a>, are you\u2026?

They roam the Backrooms in search of subjects to join their so-called \"faith\u201d. Several posters and fliers can be found on different levels advertising survivors to worship their beliefs. Their main base is situated on <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-20\">Level 20</a> and is known as \"The Faithful Grounds\".<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup></p><br><p>There are two types of Nonbelievers, Merciful Nonbelievers and Immoral Nonbelievers.</p><br><p>Merciful Nonbelievers often travel in groups consisting of 3-6 members, wandering the levels in search of humans to be part of their \"faith\" (preferably survivors who have been isolated or experiencing grief). If they come across a human subject, they will then insist they join. They will offer items as a show of hospitality, such as <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-1\">Almond Water</a>, <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-16#:~:text=Royal%20Rations%20are%20a%20white,feast%20fit%20for%20a%20god'.\">Royal Rations</a>, and other supplies to persuade individuals.</p><br><p>Merciful Nonbelievers also congregate in groups of 5-20 members, remaining stationary for a period of 5 minutes to 2 hours. During this time, they kneel on one leg with their fists making contact with the floor and their heads tucked into their chest. Additionally, Merciful Nonbelievers will also chant/speak in an unknown language to each other or during prayer.</p><br><p>If someone were to speak negatively about the Nonbeliever's beliefs, they would be warned. Continuing this behavior sends the Merciful Nonbelievers into an aggressive state. They will inflict incapacitated wounds to the spinal cord or the legs, rendering the subject unable to move.

Immoral Nonbelievers wear blue coats with red masks and assert a hostile aggression toward all life within the Backrooms. They are the only variant of the Nonbelievers that possess inhuman strength and supernatural abilities. They are often able to break through walls and levitate off the ground.

    "description": "<p>Entity 147 instances are humanoid creatures that practically are identical to humans, except for the fact that they have four arms. They often have unnaturally colored eyes- specifically, shades of purple. Entity 147 instances often wear sleeved clothing in order to hide their arms. They seem to be sapient and aware of their inhuman nature.</p><br><p>Entity 147 instances tend to act much like humans and are very group oriented, often sticking in groups of three or more. They tend to create structures out of their surroundings in order to survive. Entity 147 instances often hunt with guerilla warfare-like tactics, and only survive off of meat. They often trade with humans for resources during huge deficits of supplies, such as meat, <a href=\"/object-1\">Almond Water</a>, and materials for shelters. They have developed their own cultures in areas that they've created outposts. The exception to this human-like behavior is their <strong>rage state</strong>. Whenever they hear the words \"It's only a matter of time,\" they immediately enter an uncontrollable state in which they lose control of their body and lunge towards the person who spoke said words (who from now on will be referred to as the victim) in an attempt to tear the victim into shreds. Although hard to destroy, they are not indestructible. Sharp weapons and heavier military rounds have proved most effective against them, proving to easily penetrate their muscle tissue. Crossbows are heavily suggested. Use firearms if possible. Civilian rounds and spiked weapons also have been proven to work, though their success has been less consistent. Upon killing the victim, or getting itself killed, the rage state ends. Entity 147 instances do not remember anything happening during their rage state.</p><br><p>Entity 147 instances often create civilizations reminiscent of rural hunting villages. Purple seems to hold an odd level of significance in their culture, though the reason for this obsession is unknown. Though their languages vary, they seem to understand English, Spanish, German, and Portuguese. Outposts of Entity 147 instances seem to have obsessions over two beings. These beings are known as \"The Gardener\" and \"The Mariner.\" Both figures seem to specialize in creating levels. The Gardener specializes in making nature-based levels, while the Mariner focuses on aquatic ones. These deity-like figures are of extreme importance to most Entity 147 instances, and so it is best not to disrespect them. Outposts made by Entity 147 instances often have varying views on these two individuals. These views vary from generally respected and loved to disdained and avoided in conversations. Though pictures of these deities have not been taken, artistic representations are provided here. Each Entity 147 instance plays an integral role in their outpost. The most important of these being the hunter. The hunter often hunts game for their outpost to eat. Other integral roles include chefs, cleaners, and blacksmiths. Entity 147 outposts often have little to no governmental structures or officials. All decisions are made collectively by every instance in the outpost. The architecture of these outposts vary by level. Please refer to this list provided below for more specific information.</p><br><p>Apartment complexes/Buildings made of rubble: <a href=\"/level-11\">Level 11</a>, <a href=\"/level-13\">Level 13</a>, and several others<br/>\nWooden cabins and trenches: <a href=\"/level-135\">Level 135</a>, <a href=\"/level-10\">Level 10</a>, <a href=\"/level-37\">Level 37</a>, <a href=\"/level-47\">Level 47</a>, and <a href=\"/level-140\">Level 140</a><br/>\nDug-in shelters: <a href=\"/level-173\">Level 173</a>, <a href=\"/level-8\">Level 8</a>, <a href=\"/level-52\">Level 52</a>, and <a href=\"/level-669\">Level 669</a><br/>\nScrap metal huts: <a href=\"/level-817\">Level 817</a>, <a href=\"/level-20\">Level 20</a>, <a href=\"/level-25\">Level 25</a>, and <a href=\"/level-33\">Level 33</a><br/>\nPatient Rooms: <a href=\"/level-109\">Level 109</a>, <a href=\"/level-16\">Level 16</a>, and <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/level-524\">Level 524</a><br/>\nThe surrounding environment (Varies by level): Majority of other Levels</p><br><p>Entity 147 instances are visually identical to humans, excluding the aforementioned four arms and unnaturally shaded eyes. Internal biology varies heavily, but each instance consistently has bigger muscles and more durable bones in comparison to the average human. Blunt force often can tear muscle, but not anything further. They seem to have some sort of night vision. This is possibly correlated to their purple eyes, though this has not been confirmed. Their brains are identical to those of <em>Homo sapiens</em>. The purpose of their \"rage state\" is not well understood as of yet.</p><br><p>During a supply run by several Wanderers in <a href=\"/level-81\">Level 81</a> someone uttered the words \"It's only a matter of time\" and immediately got tackled by what looked like a normal human being with bright purple eyes and was immediately torn to shreds. The rest of the group ran away in confusion and fear as the instance returned to its docile state. They returned to a nearby <a href=\"/the-m-e-g\">M.E.G.</a> outpost and report the situation. Thanks to photographic and video evidence, it was confirmed to be a previously unknown entity.

    "title": "- \"Theodore Kingsley\"",
    "description": "<p>Entity 149, or \u201cTheodore Kingsley\u201d as he calls himself, appears to be a fair-skinned, slim built male of Scottish descent in his late 50's. He is described with oil colored hair that begins to taper into a bright grey at the sides. He is always seen with a thick, well groomed handlebar mustache. Additionally, he is frequently sighted wearing a black three-piece suit with a white undershirt and pale gold-colored cravat, but has also been sighted wearing other formal clothing. Wanderers have reported that in addition to his commonly seen suit, he also wears a silver ring on the middle finger of his right hand, which features an unidentified family crest.</p><br><p>Theodore is always seen with a worn leather satchel slung over his body. Despite the satchel\u2019s small exterior dimensions, it appears that the bag contains far more than meets the eye, suggesting that the bag is a type of <a href=\"/object-87\">Worn Sack</a>. The complete contents of this satchel are unknown, as Theodore has refused to allow researchers to look through it. The known contents of the satchel are as follows:</p><br><p>Each of these objects appear to have been made with the utmost quality, and despite their estimated age, appear to be in excellent condition. The pipe appears to be the most worn object within the satchel, suggesting a high frequency of use. Wanderers have reported that the pipe's smoke offers protection from hostile entities. A wanderer reported that when walking with Theodore through <a href=\"/level-5\">Level 5</a>, the smoke from the pipe appeared to drive back an approaching <a href=\"/entity-8\">Hound</a> and continued to push the creature back, even as they continued to move toward it.</p><br><p>Multiple reports indicate that a faint soundtrack of classical music seems to play constantly in Theodore's general vicinity. It is unknown how this music is produced. The soundtrack has been reported to consist of popular pieces by a variety of composers including Mozart, Beethoven, Bach, and Tchaikovsky. There are some lesser known pieces within the soundtrack that are presumed to be Theodore's personal favorites. Theodore is able to control this music at will, apparently able to stop or change the current song at any point he wishes.</p><br><p>Theodore is considered to be one of the more hospitable and friendly entities within the Backrooms. He is known to frequently offer food and beverages to those who seek him out and will tell them stories about his adventures throughout the Backrooms. He is known to offer these stories free of charge, but will often request that his visitors share their own stories and allow him to document them. Although Theodore is a hospitable gentleman and a kind host, he will not tolerate rudeness or disrespect towards himself or any of his guests. If guests who seek him out are disrespectful towards him, he will demand that they leave, and will refuse to interact with them again unless they display a genuine feeling of regret for their actions and offer him a meaningful apology. If he happens upon rude wanderers during his adventures who wish to hear his stories, he will likewise refuse to interact with them unless given a meaningful apology. Theodore is known to react to outright hostility (such as being attacked) with aggression, as one wanderer reported slashing at him with a knife after mistaking him for a <a href=\"/entity-10\">Skin Stealer</a> on <a href=\"/level-3\">Level 3</a>, an action which resulted in the wanderer being struck in the face, breaking his nose. The wanderer reported that when he realized his mistake and apologized, Theodore assisted him in reaching Base Gamma so that he could seek medical attention for the injury.</p><br><p>Theodore appears to remember all those who have been rude or hostile to him in the past, and will still refuse to have interactions with them even years after the instance of their hostility has passed.</p><br><p>Theodore appears to be a human male of average height and build. Rough estimates place him in his late 50's or early 60's, although limited physical tests have determined that he possesses the endurance, stamina, strength, and reflexes of a physically fit male in his prime. It is unknown whether or not his physical prowess is a product of anomalous properties, or if they are a product of a healthy lifestyle.</p><br><p>Theodore's mind is the most exceptional part of him. He has an excellent, photographic memory which allows him to keep exceptional mental records of everything he sees, hears, or reads. When questioned on the extent of this memory, Theodore proceeded to quote the entirety of Genesis to researchers, only taking a pause to catch his breath. His recitation was confirmed to be perfectly accurate to the text within the King James Version of the Bible. Theodore also claimed that his memory has allowed him to master the ability to speak, read, and write in several languages besides English, including but not limited to: Gaelic, Italian, French, Portuguese, Russian, Arabic, and Mandarin. Theodore has shown some proficiency in reading and understanding Latin, although he states that he isn't able to fluently write or speak Latin.</p><br><p>His apparent photographic memory has caused the <a href=\"/the-m-e-g\">M.E.G.</a> to seek him out as a sort of backup for their important files, a request which Theodore has denied several times, stating that due to his frequent \"dangerous adventures\" throughout the Backrooms, he is \"not the best choice for the job\". He has suggested that the M.E.G reach out to his good friend <a href=\"/entity-140\">Blanche</a> for backing up information, as she \"keeps such wonderfully accurate records\" and \"should have ample space to store them in her library.\"</p><br><p>Rumors about a wandering storyteller have circulated throughout the Backrooms for decades, the first emergence of the rumor being traced as far back as the late 1880s. The oldest written account of the rumor exists within the heavily worn diary of an unknown wanderer. The wanderer describes that a traveler they'd encountered on <a href=\"/level-11\">Level 11</a> claimed to have met a well-dressed gentleman that recounted an epic tale of his first encounter with a <a href=\"/entity-97\">Scream Eater</a>. The diary entry was dated March 10th, 1887. The first official documented encounter of Entity 149 and a wanderer was noted in a journal entry on June 23rd, 1911. The entry described a series of events in which Entity 149 recounted a story where he attempted to domesticate a female <a href=\"/entity-4\">Deathmoth</a>, but was unable due to the creature's \"obstinacy\". The entry notes that Entity 149 claimed that he \"might've been able to accomplish the task, given a deeper persistence\" but regrets that he could not as \"the sting of acid makes it hard to focus.\" The first M.E.G. encounter with Entity 149 occurred on December 8th, 2016, after he was discovered recounting stories of his first days in the Backrooms to a group of new wanderers around a makeshift campfire not far from Base Alpha on Level 1. The first M.E.G. interview with Entity 149 was done 4 days later on December 12th, 2016. Below is the official interview log between Entity 149 and M.E.G. Officer Kayn, where Kayn sits down with Entity 149 for a luncheon on Level 11.</p><br><p><strong>Begin Log: 13:41</strong><br/>\n<strong>Interviewer: M.E.G. Officer Kayn</strong><br/>\n<strong>Interviewee: Entity 149 - \"Theodore Kingsley\"</strong></p><br><p><em>[M.E.G. Officer Kayn can be heard knocking on a door. Silence for 5 seconds. The door opens.]</em></p><br><p><strong>Theodore:</strong> Officer Kayn! How delightful of you to make it. I'm sure you must be tired from your journey- please, come in. You're just in time for luncheon. How do you take your tea?</p><br><p><em>[Kayn enters the building and audibly shuts the door behind them.]</em></p><br><p><strong>Kayn:</strong> Well- I'm not exactly sure. I don't normally drink tea. I guess I'll take it however you take yours.</p><br><p><strong>Theodore:</strong> Understood. Please excuse me for a moment, I must retrieve the tea set and the sandwiches.</p><br><p><em>[Entity 149 walks off to a separate room. Silence for 15 seconds. Entity 149 returns carrying a small white tea set and a platter of tea sandwiches]</em></p><br><p><strong>Theodore:</strong> Here we are, Earl Grey. Not my personal favorite, but still a quality cup of tea, and what I had on hand. Do help yourself to the sandwiches, you must be famished.</p><br><p><em>[Entity 149 pours tea from the kettle into two porcelain mugs, adding a dash of milk and 3 sugar cubes to both cups before mixing them both thoroughly with a teaspoon. Entity 149 places one mug on a small plate, placing it in front of M.E.G Officer Kayn.]</em></p><br><p><strong>Theodore:</strong> Let me know how you find it. If it's too sweet, let me know. Feel free to add more sugar or milk to your taste.</p><br><p><strong>Kayn:</strong> Thank you very much.</p><br><p><em>[Kayn can be audibly heard taking a long sip from the mug of tea.]</em></p><br><p><strong>Kayn:</strong> Somewhat sweet- certainly not bitter. I think that third sugar cube is to blame for that. It's not an issue though, I'll manage with it.</p><br><p><strong>Theodore:</strong> I will take note of that for next time. Do try the sandwiches, I do hope they'll be satisfactory. They aren't my usual dish, but they're the best I could make on short notice.</p><br><p><em>[Kayn picks up a sandwich and observes its contents for a moment.]</em></p><br><p><strong>Kayn:</strong> If I may ask, what's in them?</p><br><p><strong>Theodore:</strong> Smoked salmon sat on a bed of cream cheese and freshly plucked watercress. My traditional luncheon appetizer is cucumber sandwiches, but I've run out of cucumber.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Kayn:</strong> Oh I'm sure these will do fine- I prefer salmon over cucumber anyways.</p><br><p><strong>Theodore:</strong> In that case, perhaps it was fortunate that I ran out of cucumber when I did. Feel free to help yourself to them, although do eat in moderation. I would hate to have a guest get sick from eating too much during one of their visits.</p><br><p><strong>Kayn:</strong> Of course- now, there was the matter of the interview.</p><br><p><strong>Theodore:</strong> Ah, yes, the interview. I must say, I've been looking forward to this. I never pass up an opportunity to tell a story.</p><br><p><strong>Kayn:</strong> As I've heard. You seem to be known throughout the Backrooms as a credible source of information, and a popular source of entertainment.</p><br><p><strong>Theodore:</strong> I would hope that my information is considered to be credible. I pour over each and every entry I collect to ensure that they are as accurate as possible. I am also pleased to hear that people find my stories entertaining.</p><br><p><strong>Kayn:</strong> The reports we've gotten from those who claim to have received information from you have never suggested otherwise. We've got at least 10 separate reports from individuals who only recently arrived in the Backrooms who claim to have gotten information on safe routes through the beginning levels from you.</p><br><p><strong>Theodore:</strong> Oh yes- of course. I remember them perfectly. I try to help the newcomers as best as I can whenever I find myself on the first few levels. This place, as you know, is quite inhospitable to those who are not prepared- which is to say- the vast majority of newcomers. Giving the new wanderers a guide on safety is the courteous thing to do, especially when it could mean the difference between life and death.</p><br><p><em>[Entity 149 removes a pipe, a small box of matches, and a bit of tobacco from his interior jacket pocket. He lights the pipe, puffing on it for a few moments before allowing the smoke to billow out of his mouth and fill the room.]</em></p><br><p><strong>Theodore:</strong> In my youth, I had always been fascinated by learning. The natural world had so many mysteries and secrets to divulge, and a young child is one of the most inquisitive creatures on God's Earth. I spent those days wandering from my home in order to explore what naive fantasies that I'd constructed for myself, although I could never bring myself to wander out of earshot from my family's estate. I suppose in those days, it nauseated me to make Mother worry. While Father endorsed my desires for adventure and exploration, Mother had doubts and held the opinion that adventure was a dangerous business and that no child so young should develop a want of leaving home. I'll admit that now, with years worth of adventure of exploration to my credit, I have often found myself longing for a taste of home. Even when our hearts crave to explore the unknown, to find the truth behind the mystery, and to see for ourselves what wonderful things are just waiting to be found, it is hard to shake the desire to return home.</p><br><p><em>[Entity 149 places his pipe down on the table in front of him. He picks up his teacup and takes a brief sip before sitting it back down.]</em></p><br><p><strong>Theodore:</strong> Home. Bah- such a fickle concept, I say. What really is home? Is it some building with all your things in it? Your storehouse for all your worldly possessions? Is home the place where you keep your food? Where you sleep? Perhaps to you, but not to me. Home is where your heart is- where your soul desires to be. Many who come here have difficulty finding this knowledge within themselves, but some do. When I first came here, I desired home- to go back to drinking tea and reading Dickens by the hearth. It was only after much time spent wandering that I learned to accept that home was not that place, fixed and static, but was a flowing enigmatic thing. Home is where you feel comfortable, it's not a place, but a feeling in your heart.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>[Entity 149 places his hand on his chest over his heart.]</em></p><br><p><strong>Theodore:</strong> Newcomers would consider the 'Frontrooms' to be their home- they are filled with the hope that they'll be able to get out someday. Not me, I have been here long enough that I no longer desire to leave. Gossip trickles back to me from time to time, I hear stories about exits- ways out of this place. I understand that some would love to return to the land before. The idea that this place is a nightmare for a great many people is not lost on me, but I could never see myself leaving. I've been here too long. The world I knew no longer exists, and this place is full of more mystery and unknowns than I could ever have hoped to explore in my lifetime. I've been here so many years, yet I've barely scratched the surface of what oddities and abnormalities it has to offer. Why should I desire to return to a benign and monotonous day-to-day existence of politics when I am free to explore, to discover, and to adventure at my leisure?</p><br><p><strong>Kayn:</strong> So.. you like it here? In the Backrooms?</p><br><p><strong>Theodore:</strong> My goodness, yes! I do admit, there are some things I have missed from before, but there is far more splendor here which more than makes up for what it is lacking. I consider myself to be a naturalist and a pioneer in the unknown. In my day, there were many untamed wilds in the world, but this place consists of nothing but untamed and malignant expanses- the dream of any man who would dare to call himself an adventurer. Not only do I enjoy this place, but moreover, it is my duty to go where others do not dare to go. It is my duty to tread through lands deemed too hostile for the common man, and it is my honor and privilege to lend my hand to the expansion of human knowledge.</p><br><p><strong>Kayn:</strong> You seem to be very proud of your work.

The road I have walked thus far pertains to the entirety of my life's greatest accomplishments. A man does not throw himself deep into the unknown, braving danger and anomaly for decades without coming to value his work. My work serves the betterment of more than myself, Officer Kayn.

    "title": "- \u201cThe Stalkers\u201d",
    "description": "<p>Stalkers usually wear regular clothing that covers much of their body. Items like hoodies, pants, and boots are all commonly seen on Stalkers. Each and every feature of their body and choice of clothing is relatively normal, and it is difficult to differentiate a human and a stalker.</p><br><p>It has also been noted by victims that Stalkers can also develop the tendency to hide from the victim, most likely to up the paranoia once it is noticed<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup>. Although Stalkers do not immediately threaten a Wanderer physically, the mental effects of being followed by a Stalker are fatal.</p><br><p>Once a Stalker begins pursuing a wanderer, it will not stop for upwards of an entire day. It is truly hard to ignore a Stalker, but ignoring one is the best thing to be done when being stalked. It seems that from many accounts, prolonged exposure to a Stalker\u2019s presence can provoke serious psychological trauma to the wanderer, mainly paranoia. When a wanderer begins to think about the stalker, that is when the fits of paranoia begin, and if this wanderer cannot ease their mind in under an hour, the Stalker becomes physically violent. In short, if one keeps thinking about the Stalker, they will be hurt or likely killed by the entity.</p><br><p>Although a Stalker will only usually become violent after this occurrence, on specific levels certain triggers can make a Stalker become hostile. The following is a compiled list of the most common triggers observed between levels:</p><br><p>These are all non-level-specific triggers. A thorough list of level-specific triggers is in the works.</p><br><p>As for the attack patterns of a Stalker, they can vary. Usually, once hostility is triggered, the Stalker will not use a weapon or surrounding object to attack or defend itself, instead resorting to just using its body to inflict physical harm. It has not yet been discerned why, but Stalkers will occasionally stop hurting a victim before said victim dies. Generally, Stalkers do make sure to kill any victim. After this, they will simply leave the victim, allowing the body to rot on the floor. Strangely, bodies killed by a Stalker rot much quicker than a typical body.</p><br><p>There is only one more notable behavior of a Stalker and this pattern is present in every known instance of a Stalker. Once a Stalker finds another wanderer nearby<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup>, it will begin to follow that wanderer instead. This is one of the possible reasons why a Stalker will leave a wanderer on the brink of death, but other explanations are also possible.</p><br><p>M.E.G. Department of Wanderer Safety, June 3rd, 2002<br/>\nOn behalf of the Major Exploration Group's Department of Wanderer Safety, I would like to address a common concern held by many wanderers. We would like to formally address and answer the following question:</p><br><p><em>\"What decides who a Stalker pursues?\"</em></p><br><p>Although many field tests have been done to attempt to answer this, it is yet unknown the exact reason why a Stalker chooses to pursue who it does. The most probable answer is that it is simply random, but for your safety and concerns, we will list some plausible theories.</p><br><p>Of these theories, only the first was proven. But still, we have not been able to figure out what causes the <strong>initial</strong> stalking to occur. We are aware that while a wanderer is being stalked, the Stalker can switch who it follows, but we do not know why the first hypothetical wanderer was stalked.<br/>\nAs an important sidenote, we have also found Stalkers standing entirely still when they are not pursuing anybody. Though we have not yet seen these idle Stalkers begin to stalk someone after this idle period.<br/>\nWe hope this answers your inquiries.</p><br><p>Regards,<br/>\nDr. Makino, head of the M.E.G. Department of Wanderer Safety</p><br><p>The reason for the lack of thorough medical analysis is because it would require the constant thought of the Stalker being observed, and as of yet, no instance of the Entity has been successfully killed, making a biopsy or autopsy even more strenuous.</p><br><p>The following is a typed version of the \"A-Notes\" found on <a href=\"/level-61\">Level 61</a>. This specific note is theorized to have taken place on <a href=\"/level-77\">Level 77</a>.</p><br><p>Sometime in December<br/>\nI got woken up earlier than usual today by one of the guys from the M.E.G. I still haven't learned his name but I've seen him around before so I decided to do whatever he said without question. Just a bit pissed that he woke me up so early, my eye lids were practically begging to close for another minute, like cmon man, it isn't bootcamp.<br/>\nAnyway, he asked me to fetch Almond Water because apparently that was my job today. I got up and walked a few train carts down, looking under seats, inside cabinets, wherever I could. By the end of it all I had two hand fulls of thermoses. But that isn't the weird bit of today, lemme tell ya, shit got WEIRD.<br/>\nThis dude kept looking at me from another cart, I went ahead and walked to the other cabin, pretty tensed up to fight, maybe he wanted my water, I dunno. Once I had shut the door of the cabin, I saw him with his head practically pressed against the glass of the other door. I ignored it.</p><br><p>Still December, same day, ran outta room</p><br><p>Hi. So the guy kept following me, cabin after cabin. I met up with another guy while switching cabins again and he pointed out the weird stalker guy. I told him it's probably no biggie, so he just walked right past the dude. Thank God he did that though, cuz then that stalker started stalking him instead of me.<br/>\nIt's safe to say I ran the hell out of there. I dropped off the almond water at the outpost cabin and rested for the rest of the day. Now that I think about it, I never saw that stalker or the other guy again. Creepy.<br/>\n<strong>Yo it's me again, writing from the future (oooooo). So I got out of the level, ended up back in <a href=\"/level-4\">Level 4</a> (for like the 40th fuckin time), and a new guy I met showed me this picture he took after I told him the story.

    "title": "- \"Xeroxes\"",
    "description": "<p>Xeroxes are shape-shifting entities which spend most of their time hibernating among the different products found in Level 480. They primarily prey on the occasional unfortunate Wanderer, though they may also attack the other entities which reside in Level 480.</p><br><p>It is impossible to deduce what a Xerox's true form and size is, since they are constantly changing to hide among new products.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup> Some reports claim that juvenile instances are unable to change their form for the first few days that they are alive, stating that they are shrivelled, tennis-ball sized crustaceous creatures, with a darkened orange colouration. Since exploration of Xerox nesting areas in Level 480 is not attempted very often, and the nesting areas themselves are hard to come by, the validity of these reports is hard to verify.</p><br><p>Xeroxes of different heritages do not tend to hide close to each other, or even within the same general area. This is theorized to occur due to territorial conflicts, or fighting that may occur over prey. This makes it so that it is very unlikely to encounter two Xeroxes in close proximity.</p><br><p>Xeroxes lead a fairly solitary lifestyle which consists of two periods: A hunting period and a hibernation period.</p><br><p>During the hunting period, Xeroxes hide in accessible areas to further increase their chances of being touched by living beings, and they lull themselves into a sleeping state to decrease their overall movement, which helps conceal their true nature.</p><br><p>When they are awoken (Sometimes randomly, without interference), they emerge from their position; screaming loudly to temporarily stun their attacker, and also to attract any entities that may be lurking about to the scene. Their screams have been recorded to reach magnitudes of up to 180Db, which can cause permanent damage, unconsciousness, and instant death to any nearby attackers.</p><br><p>Depending on the number of entities that are attracted to the scene, Xeroxes will react with one of two outcomes:</p><br><p>In both outcomes, if the attacker is killed, they will wait to see if any other entities contest for the corpse. If none do so, they feed on the corpse and begin the next phase of the cycle.</p><br><p>Very little is known about the hibernation period as is known about the hunting one. After the feeding, Xeroxes will move themselves to a harder to reach area, such as a taller part of a shelf or an air vent that may be nearby. There, they will produce their offspring.</p><br><p>After doing this, the adult Xerox spends a considerably large amount of time in a state of deep sleep, presumably to recover from producing children, whilst the offspring grow closer to becoming adults. It is currently unknown how the offspring sustain themselves nutritionally, or if they need to at all, and it is unknown how much offspring are produced with each reproduction cycle.</p><br><p>When all the offspring grow up into adults, the parent Xerox awakens from it's hibernation and resumes the hunting period. The offspring do the same thing, and the cycle continues.</p><br><p>Physically, Xeroxes are not very strong. Analysis of dead instances have shown that they are made of a brittle, cartilage-like substance. It is extremely flexible, but succumbs quickly to pressure and blunt trauma, and can also change colouration depending on what it touches in the same way a chameleon's skin does.</p><br><p>When a Xerox is alive, it can change the shape of the substance as well, but when the instance is dead, the tissue does not exhibit the same property, remaining instead in the same position and shape as the previous form it had taken before expiration.</p><br><p>According to its needs, this cartilage can be manifested into appendages or wings, and in some reports, gills.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')\">3</a></sup> This means that Xeroxes have a high adaptability to their environment, whatever that may be. This is their only advantage when it comes to mobility, as other than this, they generally lack greatly in it.</p><br><p>A Xerox's primary method of attacking is its fangs. When agitated, Xeroxes release a number of extremely powerful fangs, which can easily puncture human skin. They can also squirt out a sticky, spit-like substance from their mouths, which whilst not deadly, incapacitates any minor agitators that may fall victim to it. When used against larger beings, such as humans, it does not pose any threat and is instead simply a temporary deterrent used when fleeing the scene.</p><br><p>When a Xerox is attacking its prey, it loses the ability to change shape and add appendages. This occurs due to the fact that when attacking, Xeroxes release high amounts of adrenaline, which stiffens their bodies and makes it so they cannot shapeshift. During this phase, Xeroxes are much easier to damage and catch, but are also more deadly to make close contact with.</p><br><p>Perhaps most shocking of all discoveries made from analysis of Xeroxes is that pertaining to their pharynx. The organ is specialised to create the screams that Xeroxes are so notorious for, but if it was used in a correct manner, it would also be able to produce vocalisations and speech. However, since Xeroxes do not have the sufficient intelligence to do so currently, they have yet to vocalise any manner of speech or vocalisations other than screams.</p><br><p>So far, all testing with dead instances has shown no sexual differences, and Xeroxes are considered asexually reproducing hermaphrodites.</p><br><p>Written by <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/sariastuff\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6864497); return false;\"><img alt=\"Sariastuff\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=6864497&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334082\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=6864497)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/sariastuff\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6864497); return false;\">Sariastuff</a></span><br/>\n<a href=\"/saria\">Author page</a></p><br><p>\u00ab <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/entity-151\">Entity 151</a> | Entity 152 | <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/entity-153\">Entity 153</a> \u00bb</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/entity-152\">Entity 152</a>\" by Sariastuff, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

    "description": "<p>Entity 154 is a humanoid female entity estimated to be around 17 to 19 years of age. She calls herself Ambrosia and appears as a pale, black haired, blue eyed female standing at around 5\u2019 7, or 170\u00a0cm. She can often be seen wearing a medium length black skirt and matching pump shoes over black leggings and a white blouse. She wears a necklace chain with a small golden ring strung on it around her neck, usually hidden by her blouse or hair. She can be found on all known levels of the backrooms, seeming to not stay in one place for much time. One location she is most frequently found is Level 906, where she can be seen reading from books in the library or drinking tea.</p><br><p>She wanders around the Backrooms, seemingly without much of a reason. She is friendly to other wanderers and will often talk to them, giving them advice on navigating and travelling through the backrooms, and has also been known to give wanderers food and water. She will aid wanderers if they are hurt or being pursued by a hostile entity, showing exceptional medical and combat capabilities. Although she is friendly, she prefers to stay alone and does not seem to enjoy spending time around others for prolonged periods of time.</p><br><p>Ambrosia's biology is seemingly normal, human, when examined by just sight and touch. However, more extensive tests done on her have turned back results that do not comply with what would be expected. These results range from non-human life matter, such as plant or animal DNA, to toxins and poisons in place of blood. At this time, it is unknown what exactly she is, as further testing has proven difficult.</p><br><p>She has been reported to speak many languages, both known and unknown. She has showcased exceptional intelligence, strength, hearing, and sight. She has also claimed to possess the power to manipulate all around her, although that claim has not been proven as of the writing of this article.</p><br><p>Entity 154 is not to be treated lightly, this entity has shown signs of aggression and hostility to humans and workers in my base. It has killed and injured personnel without reason or warning; maintain caution around the entity and do not let your guard down. This entity is more dangerous than previously thought. Special precautions are to be taken to ensure this entity will not be of harm to wanderers and M.E.G.</p><br><p>As per instructions from Overseer-C, I am editing this information into Entity 154's article.<br/>\nEarlier today, at around 13:20, we were attacked by an unknown entity, who after several minutes of confrontation, was revealed to be Entity 154, calling themselves Ambrosia.<br/>\nFurther questioning for a reason behind the attack was ignored, as the entity kept moving forward with their plans, which are still unknown to us. Overseer-C and a team of volunteers decided to take on the entity in an attempt to stop it. In response to this the entity attacked Overseer -C with what seemed to be telekinetic force, resulting in Overseer-C falling into a coma.</p><br><p>In total there were 37 injuries and 3 fatalities.</p><br><p>Overseer-C woke up momentarily, 20 minutes ago, and told us to edit this article to warn others about how dangerous this entity could be.</p><br><p>Please contact us so we can reestablish communication-</p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:125%;\"><span class=\"customFont\">Terribly sorry to interrupt<br/>\nMy name is Ambrosia, or as you like to call me, Entity 154. There are a few things I would like to clear up. I understand that during our encounter I never gave you a reason for what I had done, I apologize for that as it must have caused much confusion for all of you. The reason for my so called attack is simple; you and your organization have gone beyond where you were allowed to go to by shifting the balance in favor to the humans discarding the needs of the entities that live here, all of which far longer than any of you have been here for. My job here is simple, to keep the balance among everything that lives here. For that reason, I cannot let you continue doing what you are doing currently, I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to either stop completely, or have you negotiate with me a way you can continue your project without bothering the fragile ecosystem the backrooms has depended upon for so long.<br/>\nI'm looking forward to a response.</span></span></p><br><p>~ <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/maturingsadness\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7333978); return false;\"><img alt=\"MaturingSadness\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7333978&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334073\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7333978)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/maturingsadness\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7333978); return false;\">MaturingSadness</a></span></p><br><p>\u00ab <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/entity-153\">Entity 153</a> | Entity 154 | <a href=\"/entity-155\">Entity 155</a> \u00bb</p><br>",

Despite the fact that from a distance they're an Entomophobes\u2019 worst nightmare, they look pretty cute up close.</p><br><p>[begin log]</p><br><p><strong>Arthur</strong>: Oh my g- can you guys- OKAY. STOP, fucking poking the damn things, and just give me the unholy worms.</p><br><p><strong>Stanley</strong>: Wait, you\u2019re actually going to eat them?</p><br><p><strong>Arthur</strong>: Well yeah jackass thats what we\u2019re here for ain\u2019t it. It\u2019d be fucked if we didn\u2019t discover anything and let the next poor guy die of like- diabetes. Though, if these worms are a variant of wormlings\u2026 well shit. If I die. At LEAST make sure to record what happens.</p><br><p><strong>Stanley</strong>: Alright, alright you can stop the preaching\u2026</p><br><p><strong>Arthur</strong>: Phew. Okay. Bottoms up I guess.</p><br><p><strong>[Audible pause]</strong><br/>\n<strong>Arthur</strong>: Holy shit.</p><br><p><strong>Stanley</strong>: What? Is it edible?</p><br><p><strong>Nicky</strong>: Yeah ask him if we can eat the stupid worms before asking if he\u2019s okay?<br/></p><br><p><strong>Stanley</strong>: <strong>[muffled sigh]</strong> Are you okay Arthur.</p><br><p><strong>Arthur</strong>: Better than that boys, because I might be in heaven. Get this. The red ones taste just like beef. <strong>[muffled]</strong> Mmph high qualithy cuths aht that. <strong>[audible exhale]</strong> PHEW. I could go all day, its just free meat a la carte. First meat I\u2019ve had in a while. And it doesn\u2019t look like I\u2019m dying, so I guess this is a source of food?</p><br><p><strong>Nicky</strong>: Woah thats\u2026 unexpected, hey let me tr-</p><br><p><strong>Stanley</strong>: Wait really? <strong>[picks up a handful of blue gummy worms]</strong></p><br><p><strong>Nicky</strong>: <strong>[mumbling]</strong> <em>Greedy fucker.</em></p><br><p><strong>Stanley:</strong> <strong>[audible chewing]</strong> Goddamn, you\u2019re right!</p><br><p>[end log]</p><br><p>As it turns out, these things are edible, and taste pretty damn good. We spent a few hours experimenting with them, and discovered that the worms can\u2019t actually burn or melt despite the gummy exterior, and taste great basically anyway you eat them. And even though they\u2019re practically raw meat, there\u2019s no need to cook them. Though we do recommend you cooking them, as the uncooked ones taste like raw meat and cooked worms taste properly cooked.</p><br><p>Again, they have the exact same look and feel as a regular gummy worm would. When we cut into one, it was like\u2026 much more similar to animal fat than gummy worm. They don\u2019t have what I assume normal worms have: blood or any internal organs. But after wandering around level 10 for a while, just to see if there were any more, we discovered that they originally come from a giant glob of \u201cgummy\u201d roughly the size of a soccer ball. About 200 worms come from what I named, a \u201cCluster\u201d.</p><br><p>We have no clue where Clusters originate from but you can eat them as well, it\u2019s roughly 2.5 pounds worth of TMIG. We each ate a\u2026 steak? A filet? Wiki don\u2019t exist down here dont quote me on semantics. But it all tasted like a meat dish we ate back in the Frontrooms. For me it tasted like a nice juicy steak loaded with garlic. Nicky said for him it tasted like a fried chicken steak smothered in gravy. And Stanley\u2019s tasted like chicken tenders.</p><br><p>The worms, <em>pop</em>, out of the mass of gummy worms. It\u2019s sort of like a popping a pimple. The place where the new worm starts bulging out, and after a short amount of time the worm pops out of the bulge in the \u201cCluster\u201d.</p><br><p>We were wandering around level 10 because we forgot Nicky was still there. If that idiot keeps wandering off he\u2019ll get into a nasty situation someday, but we searched until we found him poking some worms with a stalk of wheat. While messing around we discovered that one of these is just about equivalent to eating a small cubes worth of meat in proteins, fats, and acids. So, they don\u2019t kill you, they taste great, are high quality, and are a healthy source of food as well. We even made a few recipes with these things. Red = Beef, Blue = Pork, Yellow = Chicken, Green = Varies depending on how you use them while cooking. Eaten raw it just tastes like onion. Now obvious disclaimer: don't depend on three bums in a notebook log for all of your cooking advice.</p><br><p>Recipe 1 Skewered Worms - We take three of each colour and put them on a skewer. Putting one green in between colours, and then roasted them over an open fire for roughly 10-15 minutes. 2-3 skewers serve one person.</p><br><p>Recipe 2 Almond Soup - Cut about 15 of the beef ones into chunks along with 7-10 green ones, and cover it all in about two cups of almond water. Let it boil for about 30-45 minutes. If you followed the directions correctly, you should have something similar to a potato and beef stew. The green worm varies in taste and appearance every time we made the soup, 60% of the time it was potato, 30% of the time was onion, and 10% of the time we got carrots, potato, onion, and a variety of other vegetables. One standard pot serves around 3-4 people.</p><br><p>There is also a special dish you can eat at Tom\u2019s Diner. The best chef in all of the Backrooms in my humble opinion. Assorted Fried Wormies\u2026 yeahhh the name is a bitch, but the food tastes great so you won\u2019t hear me complaining.</p><br><p><span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/soyshamoy\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7438051); return false;\"><img alt=\"SoyShamoy\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7438051&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334082\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7438051)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/soyshamoy\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7438051); return false;\">SoyShamoy</a></span></p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/entity-154\">Entity 154</a> | Entity 155 | <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/entity-156\">Entity 156</a> \u00bb</p><br>",

    "description": "<p><strong>Entity Number:</strong> 160</p><br><p><strong>Habitat(s):</strong> - Entity 160 can be found on most habitable Levels, and has been sighted by wanderers in all Levels known to the M.E.G.</p><br><p>Entity 160 is the designation given to a wide variety of Entities believed to be native to every habitable Level in the Backrooms. They vary greatly in appearance from one another, but all take on the appearance and mannerisms of \"superhero\" or \"supervillain\" characters. These characters are entirely unique, and do not seem to be based on any specific figures in human pop culture. Most specimens of Entity 160 possess only minor supernatural abilities, and all are generally harmless.</p><br><p>Entity 160 specimens presenting as superheroes are generally amiable and friendly to wanderers and benign non-human Entities. On the other hand, those presenting as supervillains are hostile towards wanderers, Entities, and other specimens of Entity 160, often taking steps to sabotage and inconvenience their targets. \"Villain\" specimens of Entity 160 are rarely encountered without \"Hero\" specimens, leading some to believe that their relationship is symbiotic in nature.</p><br><p>Entity 160 specimens are capable of vocalization in most known languages. Common focuses of Entity 160 speech include monologues detailing \"evil plans,\" threats directed at other Entity 160 specimens, and reiterations of \"backstories.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup>.\"</p><br><p>Instances of Entity 160 are usually identical to humans, with some variation. They appear to be dressed in costumes fitting of the characters they present as \u2014 upon closer inspection, these costumes have been found to be constructs of unnaturally colored skin and keratin.</p><br><p>Entity 160 was independently discovered within the Backrooms by various wanderers and groups. Details can be found below.</p><br><p><strong>Alias:</strong> \"Powderman\"</p><br><p><strong>Description:</strong> A masculine \"hero\" specimen. Its costume consists of a black bodysuit, knee-high boots, cape, and cowl. It is covered at all times with a powdery white substance, which gives its costume the appearance of being completely white.</p><br><p><strong>Behavior:</strong> Powderman can be found in hazardous sections of several Levels, awaiting wanderers. Upon encountering it, it provides advice for survival (mostly consisting of contradicting statements and inaccurate information), and offers to aid and accompany wanderers in their travels. Powderman possesses the ability to produce a powdery, sweet white substance from its fingertips, which it uses to blind hostile entities and \"make 'em feel the puff.\" In the event that the powder coating Powderman's costume is more than halfway washed off, its behaviors become consistent with \"villain\" specimens, and it becomes hostile to surrounding wanderers; however, this is quickly resolved when it uses its ability to aid in combat, which usually applies a fresh coat of powder to its costume.</p><br><p><strong>Alias:</strong> \"BrainMind\"</p><br><p><strong>Description:</strong> A non-humanoid \"villain\" entity. It consists of approximately twenty-seven human brains suspended in yellow gelatin within a large rectangular glass aquarium, with sixteen irregularly-placed mechanical legs facilitating its movement. It speaks through a telephone receiver, attached to its front with screws with a cord plugged into its frontmost brain.</p><br><p>BrainMind attempts to use its size and appearance to frighten and intimidate any humans or otherwise sentient entities<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup>. All the while, it recites mathematical theorems, miscellaneous scientific facts, and bits of historical trivia of varying accuracy. When questioned as to its motives, it invariably responds with a variation of \"[You] shall drown in my immense intellect!\"</p><br><p>BrainMind is easy to evade and incapacitate, and does not seem to be particularly intelligent aside from trivial knowledge.</p><br><p><strong>Alias:</strong> \"Hole Head &amp; Whole Head<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')\">3</a></sup>\"</p><br><p><strong>Description:</strong> Hole Head and Whole Head are a duo of a \"villain\" specimen and a \"hero\" specimen, respectively. Hole Head is a humanoid entity with a large, featureless toroidal head and black skin, dressed in a black skintight bodysuit, dark grey boots, and a dark grey collared cape. Whole Head is a comparatively normal humanoid dressed in a skintight, light green bodysuit with a matching domino mask.</p><br><p>Hole head and Whole Head are very rarely seen outside of each other's company, and are usually locked in combat, be it physical, verbal, or passive-aggressive. The only supernatural capability possessed by either of them is Hole Head's ability to suspend objects within and forcibly eject objects from the empty space in the middle of its head, which it often uses in combat. This ability is believed to be the source of the animosity between the two Entities \u2014 in a wanderer's conversation with Whole Head during an apparent \"staring contest\" with Hole Head, it stated that Hole Head had \"vowed revenge\" after Whole Head attempted to re-arrange objects within its head to form an imitation of a face.</p><br><p><strong>Alias:</strong> \"Pretty Big Lady<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-4\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')\">4</a></sup>\"</p><br><p><strong>Description:</strong> Pretty Big Lady is a feminine \"hero\" instance whose costume consists of a simulacrum of a t-shirt and jeans, currently residing within a room in <a href=\"/level-13\">Level 13</a>. Its massive size prevents it from leaving the room, and inhibits its ability to stand or move. Despite this, its attitude is perpetually amiable and optimistic; it has been known to provide directions and survival instructions of varying accuracy to passing wanderers, and providing them its \"blessing\" by patting their heads.</p><br><p><strong>Alias:</strong> \"<a href=\"/entity-71\">The Red Knight</a>\"</p><br><p><strong>Description:</strong> Though the being known as the Red Knight is certainly not an instance of Entity 160, it has been observed to assist \"hero\" instances in combat and come to the aid of wanderers by non-lethally dispatching \"villain\" entities. The following is a recollection of an encounter of both instances of Entity 160 and the Red Knight, provided by wanderer Giuseppe Mosconi.</p><br><p><em>It was back when I first got dumped down here, which makes it\u2026 three weeks, at this point. Not too long ago, and I still remember it clear enough to tell it.</em></p><br><p><em>So, yeah. I woke up one morning on the floor \u2014 weird, cuz I had fallen asleep on the couch \u2014 felt carpet \u2014 weird, because my apartment has hardwood \u2014 and after a while of jus' lying there blinking and taking it all in, I decided to finally get up, and\u2026 yeah. Miles and miles of dingy yellow walls and buzzing fluorescent lights, et cetera, et cetera, you've heard it all before.</em></p><br><p><em>Anyway, like anybody who's just woken up in this hellhole, I decided to walk around and get an idea of where I was, and who's my welcoming party but just the most utterly goddamn terrifying thing I could've seen, this giant fucking fishtank filled with brains with too many legs comin' from behind the corner? I mean, in retrospect I probably shoulda kept my cool, but\u2026 yeah. Very nearly pissed myself.</em></p><br><p><em>Well, there I was, screaming my head off for help and runnin' away from this thing, when I hear this guy, kinda hammin' it up, like some sorta superhero, saying something cheesy like \"Shudder in the face of justice, vile monster!\" Heh, I can't even imitate it. So I just stop, and wait, and turn to watch expectin' this guy to hand the brain-spider a piece of its own ass, and then, like\u2026</em></p><br><p><em>I guess \"belly-flopped\" is the right word for what he did, jumpin' in the general direction of the thing and just falling flat on his face. I thought he was dead at first, the way he didn't move, and I resumed screamin' my head off after the brain-thing got back to chasing me. I didn't even care that all it was saying was some shit about Pythagoras or whatever, I was scared, aight? And I knew the other guy wouldn't save my ass, 'cuz soon as he got back up he just ran in the other direction. I thought I was gonna die, man, really did.</em></p><br><p><em>But then, just when I thought things couldn't get any more fucking weird, that big-ass knight guy came 'round the corner and just\u2026 stood there, lookin' at the both of us. And the brain-thing stopped for a moment, in the middle of givin' me a math lesson, and I could swear it and the knight just stood there and stared at each other for 10 fuckin' minutes. Finally, the thing started on a lecture on Feudalism and started scurrying towards the knight, and the knight took his sword, slipped it under the fishtank, and just flipped the damn thing on its side.</em></p><br><p><em>So after he'd led me around and away from that thing (which had, incidentally, started runnin' off equations about an object's center of gravity), of course I had to thank the guy, ask him what his deal was, 'n all that? So I did, but the first thing that came to mind was askin' him if he was like the other guy, like a superhero or some shit, and what his schtick was. And the knight looked down at me for a moment \u2014 I was sure he was glaring at me from under his helmet \u2014 until he finally, so to speak, opened his mouth.</em></p><br><p><em>And let me tell you, I've never heard a man laugh harder.</em></p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p><br><p>Additional sighted instances have been recorded in <a href=\"/entity-160-sightings\">this document.</a></p><br><p><strong>Do:</strong> Treat instances of Entity 160 with respect, and go along with their heroic or villainous routines.

    "description": "<p><strong>Entity 161</strong>, more commonly known as '<strong>Leeon</strong>', is a singular entity that resembles a toddler-sized leech with a strange fashion sense and a height of about three feet. This entity has been known to function as a sort of \"wandering salesman\", and is fully capable of human speech. If a wanderer encounters him, he will usually make an attempt to peddle a small variety of items to whomever he's stumbled upon in exchange for the person's blood. These items can range greatly in value, consisting of anything from random junk to highly sought out objects such as <a href=\"/object-16\">Royal Rations</a>.</p><br><p>Leeon's appearance greatly resembles that of an incredibly enlarged leech that's believed to be slightly above three and a half feet in total length and slightly above one foot in width. He has a pair of long, noodle-like arms that protrude out from his sides. These arms seem to entirely lack bones and end in points rather than hands.</p><br><p>His body is aligned with colors and patterns near-identical to those found on a species of already existing leech, known as the <em>Hirudo Verbana</em>, or the Hungarian Leech<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup>.</p><br><p>At the very front of his body, he has a ring-shaped mouth filled with three large, sharp teeth. The teeth are so large that he can't seem to close his mouth over them, causing him to have a permanent lateral lisp.</p><br><p>This entity is always adorned in a white collar and multicolored neck tie, located slightly above his arms. With that, he'll have white tuxedo cuffs placed slightly above the points of his arms. He's also always seen with an exaggeratedly tall and skinny light brown top hat, believed to be over four feet tall on its own<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup>.</p><br><p>With him, Leeon carries a black, leather briefcase that he uses to store the items he's collected. Despite looking like a standard briefcase, it has been shown to be able to store objects significantly larger than both it and Leeon himself<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')\">3</a></sup>.</p><br><p>No matter what climate one finds this entity in, his skin is somehow constantly wet and slippery. In some levels, one may even notice him leaving a visible trail of moisture as he slithers around.</p><br><p>Despite his moderately unpleasant appearance, Leeon is generally friendly with wanderers, if not also kind of slick. If a wanderer happens to encounter this entity or vice versa, he'll make an immediate attempt to strike up a conversation and temporarily join the wanderer on their travels or duties. He'll accompany the wanderer until he's either successfully sold them an item, been shooed off, or simply decided to go somewhere else all on his own<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-4\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')\">4</a></sup>.</p><br><p>During the times in which Leeon is conversing with a wanderer, he'll often make attempts to shift the conversation to the topic of his wares in hopes of making a sale. Should the wanderer agree to see his products, he'll open up his briefcase and advertise a selection of four to five items that usually range in quality and usefulness<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-5\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')\">5</a></sup>. The standard prices of the items seem to be completely random, but it <em>is</em> possible to haggle with Entity 161 in order to make a desired item cheaper. That being said, It's important to keep in mind to not touch an item unless you're absolutely sure you wish to buy it. For whatever reason, Leeon considers any item that has been touched 'bought', and will subsequently claim his payment whether you're willing or not.</p><br><p>Instead of accepting any form of currency or trade for his items, this entity only accepts payment in the buyer's blood. Whenever one decides to purchase an item, Leeon's hat will briefly shudder shortly before its top flips open and spurts a purple gas cloud in the face of the buyer. This gas will completely knock out most wanderers approximately fifteen to twenty seconds after inhalation.</p><br><p>When the buyer is unconscious, Leeon will then proceed to plunge his three teeth into one of the shoulders of the buyer and consume the amount of blood he's owed, using a blood sucking method similar to that of an actual leech. It's believed the gas his hat spits out is supposed to function as a sort of anesthesia, so the buyer doesn't have to feel their blood being sucked out.</p><br><p>When finished with the payment process, Leeon will leave the area and the buyer will wake up about ten minutes later with a Y-shaped scar on one of their shoulders, a mild soreness in the arm with the scar, and the purchased item sitting on the ground nearby<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-6\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')\">6</a></sup>.</p><br><p>This entity is extremely pacifistic and cowardly and will flee at high speeds if a situation happens to get violent. If cornered, he'll usually resort to hitting the aggressor with a puff of his knock-out gas before scrambling away like usual. The only other times Leeon gases something without an agreed sale comes if one tries to steal something from him, as he'll very often manage to knock out any attempted thieves with his gas before they can get away. Afterwards, he'll take both the payment for the item and the item itself back.</p><br><p>Despite his generally pacifistic nature, Entity 161 has unintentionally killed wanderers in the past by taking too much blood all at once. He does not seem to be aware of the fact that creatures actually need blood to survive, having stated that <em>\"they can always just grow more\".</em></p><br><p>At the moment, no pattern on what items Leeon deems as 'valuable' has been discovered. However, he does seem to favor specific blood types over others. He'll very often bring up blood types as an icebreaker conversation and seems to generally lower his prices for the types he favors. Currently, it is believed that his favorite blood type is B+ while his least favorite is O+.</p><br><p>This entity was supposedly sighted in early 2018, but his existence wasn't fully confirmed until late 2019, when M.E.G. operatives Norris Morrison and Ladle Spoonsly stumbled upon him during an exploration of <a href=\"/level-66\">Level 66</a>. The initial meeting and interview was recorded on Spoonsly's personal camcorder.</p><br><p><strong>Begin Log:</strong> 4:23 PM<br/>\n<strong>Location:</strong> Level 66<br/>\n<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Norris Morrison, Ladle Spoonsly<br/>\n<strong>Interviewee:</strong> Entity 161 - \"Leeon\"</p><br><p><em>(Recording begins in the middle of the two operatives having an argument.)</em></p><br><p><strong>Morrison:</strong> -dmit, her face DOES look nice, but like\u2026 dude.

Not to mention, it's- wait. Hold up. Are you recording this?</p><br><p><strong>Spoonsly:</strong> Hahah, yeah. Gonna show it to Plymouth and Juniper so they can get a scope on how <em>dumb</em> you are.

'Specially when we're waist deep in water.</p><br><p><strong>Morrison:</strong> Sucks for you. Anyways, speaking of waist deep water, we should probably head back to base by now. Wouldn't want Clair to worry about us. Plus, I'm itching to get into some pants that aren't soaked- <em>(Morrison suddenly goes silent.

When asked what happened to Leeon, both stated that he had branched from the group and went his off on his own way about three fourths of the way back to base. According to them, during the walk they explained to Leeon what milk was and then had a debate on if water was wet.</p><br><p>Within twelve hours after returning to base, Spoonsly contracted a case of norovirus, most likely due to him swallowing swamp water. He fully recovered two days later.</p><br><p>Listed below is a collection of items Leeon has sold to M.E.G. Agents. This log is kept in an attempt to keep track of what he deems as 'valuable.'</p><br><p><strong><em>The Incredible Stretching Man</em></strong> - An old Stretch Armstrong doll that's missing its left arm. Advertised as a defense mechanism that protects you while you sleep. Was purchased for nostalgic purposes in exchange for two pints of blood. As of writing this, no strange properties have been found within the doll.</p><br><p><strong><em>Modernized Whip</em></strong> - The head of a rake, glued to a meter long piece of standard rope. Advertised as both a weapon and grappling hook. Purchased for one pint of blood. It functions impressively as a weapon, but is fairly useless as a grappling hook.</p><br><p><strong><em>Lady Magnet</em></strong> - A top hat near identical to the one Leeon himself wears. Advertised as both an efficient method of gaining the attention of men and women, and as a piece of stylish headgear on its own. Cost three and a half cups of blood. Does garner attention, but not for the right reasons.</p><br><p><strong><em>Paper Sandwich</em></strong> - A book belonging to <a href=\"/entity-140\">Blanche</a>, covered in the chew marks of an unknown creature. Advertised as a food item, for those who want a 'delectable vegan food product'. When asked if he even knew what a book was, Leeon only responded with a shrug. Was purchased for a pint of blood, and subsequently returned to its owner.</p><br><p><strong><em>Portable Mental Muffs</em></strong> - A still-living chunk of a <a href=\"/entity-130\">Growler</a>, inside of a standard glass jar. Advertised as a method of blocking out mental projections coming from other hostile entities. Item still radiates the 'growling' effect, as well as Wi-Fi and a phone-charge, but none are done all that efficiently. Sold for two and a half pints of blood.</p><br><p><strong><em>Emergency Exit</em></strong> - A rubber exit sign, with a small suction cup attached to the back of it. Was claimed to function as an easy method of leaving certain levels. Cost one whole quart of blood. By suctioning the sign onto a door or window, it will usually become an entrance to a different level. Shown below are the estimates of what levels the sign can lead to.</p><br><p><strong><em>'Royal Ration'</em></strong> - A 'Royal Ration', that ended up being a strangely colored bar of soap. Item was unable to be advertised, due to the buyer being incredibly rude and disruptive. It's believed that Leeon was fully aware of the fact that the item wasn't a royal ration, but didn't correct the buyer as a form of petty revenge. Cost two cups of blood.</p><br><p><span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/prombotheseventh\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7366285); return false;\"><img alt=\"PromboTheSeventh\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7366285&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334082\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7366285)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/prombotheseventh\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7366285); return false;\">PromboTheSeventh</a></span><br/>\n<a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Medicinal_leech,_Hirudo_verbana.jpg\">Medicinal leech, Hirudo verbana.jpg</a> was posted by <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Wikiceylan&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\">Wikiceylan</a> on WIkicommons, and is licensed under <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en\">CC-BY-SA 4.0</a><br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfitoa_cndc\">Check out my sick author page!</a></p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/entity-160\">Entity 160</a> | Entity 161 | <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/entity-162\">Entity 162</a> \u00bb</p><br>",

    "description": "<p><strong>Entity 169</strong> is a semi-intelligent fungus that displays quasi-personality and expressions. The Entity emits dangerous white spores that will kill any Entity or human that breathes them in through bursting the lungs. The fungus is only classified as dangerous when within large groups, and are rather harmless and perhaps friendly in open areas or in groups of one (1) to three (3), as the emitted toxin isn't potent enough to kill.</p><br><p>The Entity, using it's assumed eyes, will display what looks to be happiness at practically everything. This includes excitement to see any humans that pass by, although the fungus does not smile towards Entities, including <a href=\"/entity-10\">Skin-Stealers</a>. This suggests they may indeed have intelligence of some kind. They have a small amount of control over their bodies, able to 'bounce' to float through the air or move on the ground, which they can also do through rolling. When one detaches from its original position it does not return, preferring to keep moving, or unable to anchor itself again.</p><br><p>At first glance, they are rather innocent creatures, but will consciously spread to other areas, and do not express regret toward any deaths that they cause; as they can be found growing on the corpses of both humans and Entities alike. It is recommended to only interact with them in small groups or in open areas, as the chance of death is significantly lower.</p><br><p><strong>Entity 169</strong> are a fungi like plague that grows in many dank or open areas. They grow in clusters and sprout on top of each other rapidly. When beginning to grow they are smoother and smaller, and harden and grow in size to about seven (7) cm in diameter. Each instance of <strong>Entity 169</strong> has two small dots facing outward, that are able to move, close and reopen, and otherwise express emotion. Instances have partial control of their 'bodies', able to roll or bounce. The mechanism in which they float through the air is still undiscovered. Further testing is required.</p><br><p>White dust emits from each instance of the Entity. This dust is commonly accepted to be spores of the Entity, a means to reproduce. They are able to begin growing on anything touched by this mist, such as a corpse or damp spot in wallpaper. Once breathed in, one will have minutes before beginning to cough up blood violently, followed by complete outward rupture of any respiratory system one may have. This normally also results in the ribcage or back being blown out as well.</p><br><p><strong>Begin Log: 08:23</strong><br/>\n<strong>Calling:</strong> M.E.G.

Pyrochelicera minds are animalistic in nature, constantly seeking food and mates. Their favored prey is <a href=\"/entity-130\">Entity 130</a> and <a href=\"/entity-66\">Entity 66</a>. Their overall intelligence varies from individual to individual. It should be noted that a dead Pyrochelicerate will attract other Pyrochelicera.</p><br><p>Pyrochelicera are large reptilian creatures, with black skin resembling that of <a href=\"/entity-187\">Entity 187</a>, and a reddish brown underside. They have inch-long, interlocking teeth in their small mouth. The species has two pairs of eyes, one located above the mouth and one located below the mouth, and four 12-meter-long wings on their body. Their body itself is quite round and ends in a short tail . They have two limbs that end in three talons underneath their wings, used for basic object manipulation. Entity 170's facial structure ends in four long tusks. Pyrochelicera are simultaneous hermaphrodites, and must reproduce with another of is kind. Entity 170's internal biology is similar to that of <a href=\"/entity-187\">Entity 187</a>, with black organs and cyan blood. They have two large hearts, four small lungs, and no stomach.</p><br><p>The first confirmed sighting of a Pyrochelicerate was made by Abraham Lena.

    "description": "<p>Evocationaries are shapeshifters that take the appearance of an important item of any wanderer. These can vary greatly depending on the childhood one had, from a childhood toy, a family photo, to a knife or a beer bottle. No one has been able to witness an Evocationary in its natural form, as even groups of wanderers have reported seeing a singular Evocationary as an important item of their past. When taken by the wanderer, the entity gives them a sense of nostalgia, and eventually sucks the wanderer into its body, which transports them to <a href=\"/level-18\">Level 18</a>. Note that they can be killed by destroying their body. Said task can vary from extremely straightforward to very difficult depending on the item the Evocationary turned into.</p><br><p>Evocationaries have three states when encountered by a wanderer known as the three R's; the Recognition, Reminiscent, and Relocation State.</p><br><p><strong>The Recognition State</strong>: The Recognition state is where an Evocationary takes the appearance of an item dedicated to a wanderer's past. Although attempts to view an Evocationary before this state have been proven futile, it is known that once entity 173 has successfully morphed, a wanderer is suddenly overcome with an extreme feeling of desolation. During this state, one must make all attempts to find the Evocationary, as it does not attempt to make itself known - this has led a few <a href=\"/the-m-e-g\">M.E.G.</a> members to the brink of suicide. Be wary that if one is in a group and all are going through this state, a few may become violent and use physical combat to get to the entity first. Once a wanderer has recognized and taken the entity, it moves on to its second state.</p><br><p><strong>The Reminiscent State</strong>: This occurs once a wanderer picks up the entity. In this state, one will find themselves trapped in nostalgia, and will remember every single memory of the item the Evocationary has taken the appearance of, leaving them frozen in a vegetative state. As this occurs, anyone with the victim will be free of the negative emotions that came from the first state, and will no longer feel the need to take the entity away from them. However, they will still see it as their childhood item. At this point, the other wanderers now have a chance to quickly swipe the Evocationary and kill it. Understand, however, that the victim will still be violent.<br/>\nNote: This state can be prevented by resisting the urge to take the Evocationary and killing it right away. However, know that this takes an incredible amount of willpower to refuse this urge.</p><br><p><strong>The Relocation State</strong>: This is the final state where the wanderer is sucked into the Evocationary and is teleported to <a href=\"/level-18\">Level 18</a>. Eyewitnesses report seeing entity 173 float out of a victim\u2019s hands and pull them in. As of recent, the victim hasn\u2019t been found. According to <a href=\"/the-m-e-g\">M.E.G.</a> reports, upon transport to <a href=\"/level-18\">Level 18</a>, the level seems to have an interesting effect on Evocationaries, as their properties seem to change when encountered there. The item that the wanderer sees upon transport to <a href=\"/level-18\">Level 18</a> no longer seems to have any mental or emotional effect on them, and now seems to be covered in \u201cstatic\u201d. The Evocationary now seems to be safe to interact with. However, be wary that some effects may continue to last because of the level itself.</p><br><p>Depending on the childhood of a wanderer, Evocationaries take on three different forms: the Comfort, Trauma, and Covet Form.</p><br><p><strong>The Comfort Form</strong>: The most common of the three, the Comfort Form, is where Evocationaries take the appearance of a cherished item that belonged to a wanderer with a happy childhood. Examples include but are not limited to: a plush toy, an action figure, or an accessory. When in this form, wanderers will find themselves desperate and violent and will do anything necessary to take the entity.</p><br><p><strong>The Trauma Form</strong>: The second most common, the Trauma Form, is where entity 173 takes the form of an item that is related to a wanderer with trauma/a bad childhood. Examples include but are not limited to: knives, empty beer bottles, and whips. Two things may occur here: one will use this entity as a way to hurt others, which makes other wanderers break free from the Recognition State entirely - or they try to run away from the entity, which creates a paradox from the first state which usually leads to death unless another wanderer kills the Evocationary. Note that the effects each form has on a different wanderer are fairly similar to one another, with the only exception being visible panic or using the entity as a weapon being the one thing that separates the Trauma Form from the latter two.</p><br><p><strong>The Covet Form</strong>: The final and rarest form is taken when a particular wanderer lacks a certain childhood that allows for an Evocationary to take the Comfort or Trauma Form. This is where the entity shifts into an item that a wanderer always wanted in their life but was never able to get. Examples include but are not limited to: jewelry, a toy, or an accessory. This will leave the same effect Comfort Forms have on wanderers.</p><br><p>As mentioned previously, it is unknown what the true form of an Evocationary is. Attempts to take photos of the entity has only led to broken devices, unprocessed films, or incredibly glitchy images that are not reliable enough to confirm what the real form of an Evocationary is. However, its appearance in death has been documented. Upon killing entity 173 through means of crushing, it melts into an incredibly acidic substance similar to that of Fluoroantimonic Acid. It is strongly encouraged to not come into contact with an Evocationary after it\u2019s death.</p><br><p>Entity 173 was discovered on February 4th, 2012 when a man by the name of \u201cCampbell Pacquet\u201d stumbled upon it on <a href=\"/level-11\">Level 11</a>. Upon first discovery, Evocationaries were listed as an object, but as more reports came in and it was found that they could be killed, it was relisted as an entity. Written below is the transcript for a group interview led by researcher Catelyn Rodriguez. This interview reveals how Evocationaries were found to be an entity rather than an object based on the accounts of three people.</p><br><p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Catelyn Rodriguez<br/>\n<strong>Interviewee 1 (Inter. 1):</strong> Campbell Pacquet<br/>\n<strong>Interviewee 2 (Inter. 2):</strong> Lara Quigley<br/>\n<strong>Interviewee 3 (Inter. 3):</strong> Russel Winship</p><br><p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Good day. I\u2019m Dr. Catelyn Rodriguez, a researcher of a <a href=\"/the-m-e-g\">group I\u2019m sure you\u2019re all aware of</a>.<br/>\n<strong>Inter. 3:</strong> Yeah, the <a href=\"/the-m-e-g\">M.E.G.</a> How many interviews have I been pulled for them already?<br/>\n<strong>Inter. 2:</strong> I shouldn\u2019t even be here right now, I have a life to live.<br/>\n<strong>Inter. 1:</strong> A life to live? Here, in the Backrooms? Boy, what a joke.<br/>\n<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Yes, yes, I understand that and I do apologize deeply for the inconvenience. However, we\u2019ve read your reports on a certain object you have all seen that, oddly enough, seem very related to each other; therefore, <a href=\"/the-m-e-g\">the M.E.G.</a> has decided to have you all come back for one more interview.<br/>\n<strong>Inter. 1:</strong> Fine. But we better get this done fast.<br/>\n<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Right, yes. Mr. Pacquet, is it? Tell me about the encounter you had on the 4th of February, 2012.<br/>\n<strong>Inter. 1:</strong> I told this story a million times, and nothing\u2019s even happened since then.<br/>\n<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Perhaps to the other interviewers. But not to us. Besides, if you\u2019re so hasty to take your leave, you\u2019ll have to retell this story one more time.<br/>\n<strong>Inter. 1:</strong> Gah, fine. I was walking through <a href=\"/level-11\">Level 11</a>, trading, when something caught my eye \u2014 some sort of toy. I was about to ignore it, when all of sudden I felt like sobbing if I didn\u2019t take a look again. Bloody embarrassing, that was; when I turned around to look at it again, it disappeared. I felt\u2026 almost desperate to search for it. So that\u2019s what I did \u2014 I ran around like some kind of git until I found it. And what do you know, it was this old Transformer action figure from the 80s. I had one of them when I was a kid \u2014 got it as soon as my hands could grab \u2018em. Anyhow, I picked it up and\u2026 I felt safe holding the bloody thing. I blinked and somehow, ended up in <a href=\"/level-18\">Level 18</a>.<br/>\n<strong>Interviewer:</strong> I see. Lara Quigley, why don\u2019t you tell me about July 25th, 2013?<br/>\n<strong>Inter. 2:</strong> Alright\u2026 I was scavenging for supplies down in <a href=\"/level-13\">that infinite apartment complex level</a>, when in one of the rooms I saw a little doll\u2026 she had red hair and black eyes\u2026.<br/>\n<strong>Inter. 3:</strong> Sounds like something straight out of a horror movie.<br/>\n<strong>Inter. 2:</strong> A what?<br/>\n<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Ahem. Please, continue.<br/>\n<strong>Inter. 2:</strong> Oui, yes. I sat on the floor, and held her in my hands. I realized I had a doll like this once, as a little girl. I hadn\u2019t felt so close to something quite like it since I lost the thing. There were\u2026 tears in my eyes. It has been a long time since I ever cried like that, it would have been quite ignominious had I been with anyone at the time\u2026. I must have been in some sort of trance, because when I looked up, I wasn\u2019t in the room anymore, but in some sort of\u2026 <a href=\"/level-18\">classroom</a>.<br/>\n<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Understood.<br/>\n<strong>Inter. 3:</strong> Suppose it\u2019s my turn now? Yeah, I think I\u2019m starting to see the pattern here. September 1st for me. Found the thing in <a href=\"/level-1\">Tom\u2019s Diner</a>, just laying right on the bar counter. It was\u2026 a broken beer bottle, think there were smudges of grease at the neck and the base was all cracked up\u2026. Anyway, there were a bunch of strangers in there that looked at it with desperation, it was kind of scary. But for me, I\u2026 I felt fear. So much of it. Everyone started making a run for the thing, screeching out weird things, saying they were seeing a toy or something\u2026 I grabbed the thing, threatened to kill anyone with it. Right before I could even swing, I\u2026 ended up in <a href=\"/level-18\">Level 18</a> too.<br/>\n<strong>Inter. 1:</strong> Well, if that wasn\u2019t a refreshing break from all the pure stuff. <em>[laughter from Inter. 1, then brief silence]</em> \u2026Tough crowd.<br/>\n<strong>Interviewer:</strong> \u2026Anyhow. As you all may have guessed, there is indeed a pattern. Each of you encountered something different, but with one thing in common. The objects you saw were related to your past. Tell me, after you were all transported to <a href=\"/level-18\">Level 18</a>, what did the object do after?<br/>\n<strong>Inter. 1:</strong> Well, for me, I didn\u2019t feel anything towards the thing anymore, but it was all covered in\u2026 what would you call it\u2026 a glitch?<br/>\n<strong>Inter. 3:</strong> Static? <em>[Inter. 1 nods]</em> That happened to me too. Touching it did nothing after.<br/>\n<strong>Inter. 2:</strong> I suppose I can confirm this to have happened to my\u2014 the doll as well.<br/>\n<strong>Interviewer:</strong> I see. Thank you, all three of you. This is crucial information\u2026 I now doubt we have a simple object in our hands.</p><br><p>Written by <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/trailmixncocoa\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7579964); return false;\"><img alt=\"TrailmixNCocoa\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7579964&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334082\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7579964)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/trailmixncocoa\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7579964); return false;\">TrailmixNCocoa</a></span></p><br><p>\u00ab <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/entity-172\">Entity 172</a> | Entity 173 | <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/entity-174\">Entity 174</a> \u00bb</p><br>",

    "description": "<p><strong>Behaviors:</strong><br/>\nFrom what has been observed, The Webmaker (entity 175) remains stationary, but possesses the capabilities to shift the basic fabric of levels in different ways. This was explained to us in extensive, albeit confusing details provided by them. They also claim to be the sole reason why other levels are known to shift and change, though until future research and study can be done, these claims are dubious at most.</p><br><p>Other than that, I can\u2019t say we\u2019ve observed much more than the floating ribbons shuffle and move with The Webmaker\u2019s speaking. They\u2019ve additionally informed us that they enjoy fooling people, clarifying that they may or may not be telling any sort of truth whatsoever.</p><br><p>Regardless, we were informed by The Webmaker that they do not appear in their physical form for us, instead having multiple instances of thread \u201ceverywhere and anywhere at once [sic]\u201d used to look into other spaces. This was confirmed by The Webmaker when they were accurately able to list the location and actions of our secondary team outside Level 244.</p><br><p>Because of the nature of Entity 175 and their capabilities, additional researchers from the I.M.B.H. and other key organizations were notified and requested for assistance.</p><br><p><strong>Biology:</strong><br/>\nSpecifics on The Webmaker\u2019s biology are unclear, though they were polite enough to provide a general understanding of their function and appearance.</p><br><p>From what has been detailed, Entity 175 has a physical form composed of a lanky body of birch branches wrapped and formed into a general humanoid shape. Purple ribbons are said to radiate from the gaps between the birch of their form, though it hasn\u2019t been made clear if they radiate eternally or have an end. Regardless, these are the only portions of The Webmaker visible, appearing floating straight from the ground or floating in the air freely.</p><br><p>These ribbons, based on what has been told to the biology team, can infiltrate and make their way seamlessly into levels and other spaces. According to The Webmaker, these act in an almost parasitic way, able to weave and shift places however the entity chooses. Somehow, in ways that are unclear to us, The Webmaker enjoys misleading and confusing humans by altering levels. We have not been told why this is done, but based on how they speak of us. It can be assumed this is due to simple spite.</p><br><p>Entity 175 has also proven to be fairly clever, offering to provide their own writings and information when it comes to their own documentation. Doing so was achieved by simply dropping an electronic device or paper into the water-filled opening in the floor, which was soon returned minutes later by one of The Webmaker\u2019s many ribbons.</p><br><p><strong>History:</strong><br/>\nThe significance of The Webmaker\u2019s history was never apparent due to their relative obscurity and preference for being unseen. However, according to The Webmaker, they had a dormancy period that dated from between the late 1800s up until the 1980s when they \u201cawoke from slumber\u201d as they called it.</p><br><p>Before this period of dormancy, The Webmaker claims to have participated in the misguidance of humans for years prior. Given the context provided by The Webmaker, they seem to gain some kind of pleasure and sense of strength from doing so. In this pre-dormancy time, Entity 175 had also been in contact with other entities such as Blanche. Unfortunately, The Webmaker claimed to have annoyed them sufficiently enough to be removed from The Cygnus Archive and other similar domains.</p><br><p>Following an encounter and eventual disagreement with a \u201cPantheon Individual,\u201d as they called it, The Webmaker suffered some kind of physical injury serious enough to require significant rest to recover from.</p><br><p>In the modern era, The Webmaker claims to continue their meddling and alteration of levels but confesses that it is more of an involuntary process than a voluntary one.</p><br><p>Other details are incredibly inconsistent, vague, and incoherent, but The Webmaker has never stated how long they have existed, let alone why or how they came to be.</p><br><p><strong>Do's and Don'ts:</strong><br/>\nUnfortunately, it is nearly impossible to know when someone is in the presence of Entity 175. Regardless, The Webmaker is only known to minorly inconvenience people, and at worst, can lead people to fairly dangerous situations that could be avoided with quick thinking. Regardless, we cannot provide an accurate list of what someone should and should not do. The most we, at the Charles Darwin Center for Biological Research, can do is to be polite and avoid all possible encounters with The Webmaker to begin with.</p><br><p>This can be done by:</p><br><p><strong>Additional Notes:</strong><br/>\nWhen it comes to the eventual publication of this page, we shall be allowing The Webmaker to make personal additions to this page in order to hopefully provide a greater understanding of their existence. If done properly, the following section will include their own personal writing.</p><br><p>I choose to write elsewhere. I\u2019m not one to be controlled. That should be made clear through my other recounts. Those will be placed between all this.</p><br><p>Whilst my eyes gazed into the well, I continued to observe them questioning and making sense of whatever came from my mouth. They took it at face value despite knowing my nature very well. I could\u2019ve spoken only lies, and they would\u2019ve taken it as fact. Of course, I would never confess if I was indeed telling the full truth. That is simply my nature\u2026</p><br><p>That can be for you to decide.</p><br><p>\u00ab <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/entity-174\">Entity 174</a> | Entity 175 | <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/entity-176\">Entity 176</a> \u00bb</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/entity-175\">Entity 175</a>\" by RoseMonsignor, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

Despite its tone, <strong>M</strong> was glad to talk to a wanderer, claiming it \"doesn't get that opportunity too often\".

It should be noted that the reliability of Damian's testimony is not concrete, as he has had a history of memory problems prior to the event in question.</p><br><p><strong>Begin Log: 13:47</strong><br/>\n<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Officer Raines<br/>\n<strong>Interviewee:</strong> Damian \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</p><br><p><strong>Raines:</strong> State your name for the record, please.</p><br><p><strong>Damian:</strong> Uh, Damian?</p><br><p><strong>Raines:</strong> Please describe the entity you have encountered.</p><br><p><em>(Damian stammers for a moment)</em></p><br><p><strong>Damian:</strong> Uh\u2026 I-I have a sketch of it right here-</p><br><p><em>(Damian begins to pull out a sketch of Entity-179 before being interrupted by Raines)</em></p><br><p><strong>Raines:</strong> My apologies. Allow me to clarify: please explain the entity's <em>behavioral</em> patterns - its general demeanor, any notable abilities that it has, any signs of hostility, et cetera.</p><br><p><strong>Damian:</strong> Oh, ok. Got it. Uh\u2026 Here, l-lemme start from the beginning. I think I was in level\u2026 57? 56? Which one's the one with the subway tunnels?</p><br><p><strong>Raines:</strong> Level 59?</p><br><p><strong>Damian:</strong> That's the one! Thank you. Back on topic, uh\u2026 I was being chased by one of those big smiley guys when all of a sudden it starts to make this weird hissy noise. Then it, like faded out or something. So naturally, I'm sitting there on the ground like \"What the fuck just happened?\" All I could see was this white circle.</p><br><p><strong>Raines:</strong> Am I correct in assuming this white circle is the lens on its headgear?</p><br><p><strong>Damian:</strong> Yup. So then it takes me back to one of the brighter parts of the Level and I got a good look at its face, which- y'know, obviously, it's right there on the table.\"</p><br><p><em>(Damian laughs awkwardly)</em></p><br><p><strong>Raines:</strong> With all due respect, sir, this doesn't exactly tell us anything about how it acts-</p><br><p><strong>Damian:</strong> Hold on, I'm getting to that part. Ok, so\u2026 how do I describe this\u2026</p><br><p><em>(Damian pauses for a moment before continuing)</em></p><br><p><strong>Damian:</strong> Ok so, it kinda like\u2026 forced me to think \"Are you alright?\" Which confused me at the time because I had no idea why I was thinkin' that, y'know? So I ask if it's a good guy, and I think \"As long as you don't interfere with my work, I will not bring you harm.\" So at that point, I'm like, REALLY freaked out, since I'm thinkin' things that I didn't really make the decision to think, before the weird little flesh things comin' out of its chest started to beat like a heart. It gets a bit foggy after that, but after they stopped I was totally calm\u2026</p><br><p><strong>Raines:</strong> This is its ability to \"consume fear\" that you described, I presume?</p><br><p><strong>Damian:</strong> Correct. So after I calm down, I realize \"hey wait a second, are you talking to me through my mind?\" To which I think \"yes\" in response. So I guess this thing can\u2026 like\u2026 force you to think what it wants to say? I dunno, that's how I took it.</p><br><p><strong>Raines:</strong> That's quite interesting. Did you attempt further communication?</p><br><p><strong>Damian:</strong> Bet your ass I did! Pardon the language, uh\u2026 ok! Actually, now that I think about it, I think it tried talking to me first. My memory's not exactly the best, never has been, but I think it said something like \"You're lucky I needed a Smiler, you need to be more careful\" or something like that. So I apologize, and ask who it is. Apparently, this thing's memory is as bad as mine, since it couldn't even remember its own name! Well, it couldn't remember the whole thing, only that it started with an M. Said it used to be like us, but then it found something way deeper than where we were at the time that turned it into what it is now.</p><br><p><strong>Raines:</strong> Could you tell what the item was?</p><br><p><strong>Damian:</strong> Uh\u2026 I think it said it was the goggle? I dunno, that part's a bit blurry. Sorry.</p><br><p><strong>Raines:</strong> And you said this \"item\" turned it into the entity you saw?</p><br><p><strong>Damian:</strong> Yeah, but it said it didn't really consider itself human, whatever that means.</p><br><p><strong>Raines:</strong> I see. Please continue.</p><br><p><strong>Damian:</strong> Uh, ok. So! I asked it how it was able to kill the smiley guy, and apparently it's able to see where exactly to stab the guys with its goggle eye thingy. I thought that was badass, so I told it so. Then it like, laughed, and said something like \"I haven't spoken with a drifter in so long, this is refreshing,\" something along those lines. So, we chatted for a bit, just basic \"what's your favorite food, which Golden Girl was the funniest\", before I realize - hey wait a sec, it NEEDED a smiley thing? What did it need the thing for?</p><br><p><strong>Raines:</strong> Funnily enough, that was my next question. A source of food, I assume?</p><br><p><strong>Damian:</strong> Actually, it didn't even eat the smiley. Apparently it's a bounty hunter for some big guy it called its \"boss\" or something. But when I questioned it on who that guy was, it just said \"don't worry about it, you don't know what you'd be getting into\" before flicking its cape at me! After that, it gets SUPER foggy, but somehow I ended up on Level 4? I dunno, I'm still kinda trying to process that last part!</p><br><p><em>(Damian laughs)</em></p><br><p><strong>Raines:</strong> So it hunts other entities for some unknown bigger picture? That sounds like it could be of concern. Very well, thank you for the information.</p><br><p><strong>Damian:</strong> You bet! Thanks for hearin' me out. Hope all that info helps you guys at least somewhat.</p><br><p><strong>Raines:</strong> I'm sure it will.</p><br><p><strong>Summary:</strong> Officer Raines reported xyr findings to M.E.G. Headquarters. After a brief debate on how to handle the issue of <strong>M</strong>'s employer, It has been concluded that further research is to be conducted on Entity-179 to determine its true intentions, and whether humans would fall under its potential bounties. As for Damian, he is currently residing peacefully in Level 4.</p><br><p><strong>End Log: 17:59</strong></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:xx-large;\"><strong>Do's and Dont's</strong></span><br/>\n<strong>Do:</strong></p><br><p><strong>Don't:</strong></p><br><p><strong>Mmm, actually don't it's weirdly dehumanizing.

    "description": "<p>Berry is a black cat that appears to be of the Domestic Longhair breed. He has been reported to have the ability to \"enlighten\" or \"ascend\" wanderers who gaze into his eyes. He is constantly surrounded by his protective worshipers.</p><br><p>Berry can allegedly \"enlighten\" wanderers when they look into his eyes. His worshipers refer to this phenomenon as \"visions of reality.\" Berry is able to make vocalizations, but only those typical of cats. To communicate, he will stare into the eyes of his followers. It is currently unknown what information they receive during these interactions, but they are then able to speak for Berry. His worshipers who refer to themselves as \"Visionaries\" will protect Berry at all costs and provide constant food and attention. It is believed that Berry can not control his effects but will not intentionally prevent wanderers from falling victim to them. Berry is docile, only becoming angry when held for extended periods of time. Berry can be given food and attention, but it is recommended to do so with caution. The Visionaries are quite protective of him and will fight off any who they see as threatening. Do not mention <a href=\"/entity-7\">Jerry</a> near Berry or his followers, this will cause an immediate hostile reaction.</p><br><p><span style=\"font: 1.9rem Italianno;\">Berry is an absolute treat to be in the company of. He is so sweet, curling up on my lap while I'm reading. He spends most of the time sleeping on the various chairs throughout my home. I can see why you all adore him so much, dear Visionaries.</span></p><br><p>Berry appears to be a neutered male cat of older age. His fur is black, with one notable feature being two white whiskers on the left side of his face. Berry does not have to eat but will eat nearly anything not directly plant-based. It is highly recommended to not make direct eye contact with Berry, as this causes wanderers to become \"enlightened.\" His followers, only comprised of wanderers, are fully capable of functions similar to normal humans, but are extremely protective of Berry and worship him similarly to a deity. It is theorized that Berry gained these properties after an accidental encounter with <a href=\"/entity-140\">Entity 140</a>.</p><br><p><span style=\"font: 1.9rem Italianno;\">Berry, my dear, I apologize for what happened. I had never meant for you to Witness The Beyond, but you were too close to that unfortunate wanderer\u2026 I understand why you ran away, though. I hope you forgive me. Do know that I will always welcome you back, Berry.</span></p><br><p>The first-ever sighting of Berry was approximately 400 years ago. Berry typically has 10-20 worshipers surrounding him at once. Do not attempt any interaction unless necessary. <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">Berry can typically be found in <a href=\"/level-4\">Level 4</a> or <a href=\"/level-512\">Level 512</a>.</span></p><br><p><span style=\"font: 1.9rem Italianno;\">I'm truly sorry Visionaries, but Berry is back where he belongs, back at home, with me. I hope you all understand, but unfortunately, I know you won't. Berry is safer with me than he ever was with you. And I intend to keep it that way.

    "description": "<p>From afar you could not tell there was something wrong with them. Just another bunch of youngsters hanging out in the outskirts of the city, but as I came closer, things started to get\u2026 weird. You expect lads that age to make lots of noise and be annoying, but these were nothing like that. They were standing there, not moving, not talking, just\u2026 impossibly still.</p><br><p>By the time I noticed the other stuff, the unnaturalness of their stance, the slight aura around them\u2026 well, they noticed me too. I was paralyzed. I had heard of them, but never thought I would actually encounter those monsters, not in Level 11 at least. They\u2026 they turned their heads towards me, and their movements felt artificial, like something else faking being human. That was scary, but it was when I saw their eyes, that red tempest of sheer wrath, that's when I ran.<br/></p><br><p><em>\u2014 Preston.<br/>\nTestimony of an encounter with the <strong>Servants</strong>.</em></p><br><p>Entity 187.</p><br><p>The minds of people who transform into <strong>Servants</strong> seem to remain intact, as they often use memories of their former selves to deceive those they knew in their past life. Yet there seems to be no trace left of who they once were. Those who have interacted with loved ones transformed into <strong>Servants</strong> claim that they were nothing like the people they knew, their personalities completely erased and replaced by something else.</p><br><p><strong>Servants</strong> are primarily engaged in acting as tools for the <em>Ambassadors</em>' activities, fulfilling a multitude of different roles. These include, but are not limited to:</p><br><p>The <em>Ambassadors</em>' main limitation when it comes to abducting their victims is their inability to physically interact with their environment. This lack is compensated by the <strong>Servants</strong>, who are able to restrain and immobilize the wanderers that their <em>Ambassador</em> sees fit.</p><br><p>The <strong>Servants</strong> act not only as the <em>Ambassadors</em>' hands, but also as their eyes and ears, a network of silent informants scattered throughout the Backrooms. It is important to remain vigilant and make sure you are aware of your surroundings, you can never know who might be listening.</p><br><p>Although not as effective as in the days following their first sightings, these kinds of tactics continue to be used by the entity. They seek to attract victims by acting in unusual ways, interacting with wanderers they met in the past, and even helping individuals in need, only to then direct them to a much greater danger.</p><br><p>Ultimately, <strong>Servants</strong> serve as a constant reminder. An ever-present display of what happens to those who fall prey to an <em>Ambassador</em>. Sometimes they can be seen marching in droves through large population centers, not with any specific mission, but sent by the <em>Ambassadors</em> to be seen.</p><br><p>Most <strong>Servants</strong> seem to act mindlessly, but some scattered reports mention the existence of <strong>Servants</strong> that, to an extent, retain their mental capacity. <strong>Servants</strong> of this type comprise a rare minority, and are sometimes seen giving speeches to wanderers in an attempt to convince them to become a part of their \"community\", with promises of \"a paradise in which we are all one\" and \"an existence as part of the master\".</p><br><p>Though it is believed that the base biology of the individual is maintained after they lose their humanity and become a <strong>Servant</strong>, there are some significant changes in their biological properties. The most prominent change is the loss of body coloration, which causes them to have an ashen skin tone. They have never been seen eating, and on the few times that wanderers managed to inflict serious wounds on them, they were not seen to bleed. In addition, instead of healing in the regular way, the <strong>Servants</strong>' wounds glowed with a reddish light similar to that of their eyes, which healed them at a slow pace.</p><br><p>I was part of this\u2026 project, yes. The autopsy of a Servant, it was quite rudimentary, if I may say so. No, I will not share information regarding the party that provided the body and everything else, I would rather not jeopardize my chances of working with them again in the future.</p><br><p>I will be brief, as I don't want it known that it was me who agreed to discuss the results of our little investigation. I'll just say that all of your theoretical observations are correct, both the outer casing and the inner tissues turn gray at some point in the transformation to Servant. Furthermore, all internal fluids were gone, no blood, no gastric juices, no nothing. I found this disconcerting, as the blood system remained intact, there was no sign that the fluids had been removed, they just vanished. But the most striking thing was the state of the body, as I was told the subject had been a Servant for about 1 year. A year without any of these essential components and it remained\u2026 surprisingly intact.</p><br><p>To this day I can't explain how, but there was no sign of putrefaction in that body.<br/></p><br><p><em>\u2014 Anonymous.<br/>\nTestimony of an encounter with the <strong>Servants</strong>.</em></p><br><p>The consensus among archivists is that stasis of the <strong>Servants</strong>' internal systems has no impact on their functionality, and that they no longer require the natural processes of a conventional human being to survive. Instead, they seem to receive the energy that allows them to continue living directly from the <em>Ambassadors</em>.</p><br><p>A few months after the first disappearances attributed to the <em>Ambassadors</em>, the victims began to return transformed into <strong>Servants</strong>. Although they were initially greeted warmly, their acquaintances soon realized that something had gone terribly wrong.</p><br><p style=\"text-align: center;\">The following excerpt is the earliest documented interaction with a <strong>Servant</strong> the M.E.G. possesses. The interview is conducted by M.E.G. Volunteer Anton Mauri, who managed to take custody of former M.E.G. Archivist Roger Soler. Soler was among the first group of <strong>Sevants</strong> who arrived Level 11. He was taken to Base Eta, a small research outpost that housed around 13 people.</p><br><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size:130%;\"><strong>Interview Log: Roger S.</strong></span></p><br><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size:80%;\"><strong>Excerpt - 05/08/2017</strong></span></p><br><p><strong>[M.E.G.

Roger, I can only Imagine the time you spent away\u2026 with them, I understand that you might not like to talk about it, but you know how this goes. This is important, this can\u2014 this will save lives, so I must ask you, would you tell us about it?</p><br><p><strong>[Roger S.]:</strong> I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what to talk about.</p><br><p><strong>[M.E.G. Anton]:</strong> Well, we can start by the most obvious. You\u2026 you are all gray now, Roger. Do you feel any different?</p><br><p><strong>[Roger S.]:</strong> I feel good, better than ever.</p><br><p><strong>[M.E.G. Anton]:</strong> That\u2019s good, very good. We can rule out major\u2026 repercussions, then. Don\u2019t worry Roger, we\u2019ll figure out how to fix this mess eventually, but if there is no discomfort, then we can proceed.</p><br><p><strong>[Roger S.]:</strong> All right.</p><br><p><strong>[M.E.G. Anton]:</strong> Why don\u2019t we go back to the beginning? The last record we have of you is when you encountered the entity, what happened after that?</p><br><p><strong>[Roger S.]:</strong> The Ambassador, it showed me, it showed me!</p><br><p><strong>[M.E.G. Anton]:</strong> What did it show you, Roger? What did you see?</p><br><p><strong>[Roger S.]:</strong> I saw\u2026 home, paradise.</p><br><p>[M.E.G.

You don't have to share everything with us right now, we can get into details later. For now, I think it would be better for you to eat, god knows what they fed you, if at all.

    "description": "<p>The Scomparsa is a gigantic pterodactyl-like creature (although it has more in common with the Quetzalcoatlus) that hunts the bigger quarries of level 669, hunting by means of echolocation.</p><br><p>The Scomparsa roams the deepest parts of level 669. Unlike regular prehistoric and antediluvian birds It does not attempt to reproduce or build nests for unknown reasons, however, the leading theory is that the Scomparsa is the last of an extinct species in level 669. As there is only one of it it is extremely rare to see, however when you do see it, it could be too late.</p><br><p>The Scomparsa uses echolocation to see its way around the quarries it flies through, making loud shrieking sounds when doing so. If you make too much noise it will find you, wherein it will likely try to dive toward your location. If it manages to catch you in its beak you will likely be crushed to death by its teeth.</p><br><p>The Scomparsa resembles that of a completely eyeless Quetzalcoatlus. Although its exact species can\u2019t be determined, if it even is a real-life dinosaur at all, it has the most in common with the Quetzalcoatlus in terms of size and general posture/flying habits.</p><br><p>The Scomparsa is over thirty feet in height and has an extremely sharp beak that it uses to kill its prey in one snap. It is the only creature of its species due to unknown reasoning. Several features such as a massive scar over its beak have shown that all sightings of the Scomparsa are of the same individual.</p><br><p>The Scomparsa was originally told of by the prophets, who warned M.E.G. operatives of its presence in the deepest depths. It is entirely possible that an exit can be found in these deep locations (such as \u201cgame over\u201d), however, the Scomparsa\u2019s constant presence in this area has made it near impossible for anyone to stay in these areas long enough to locate a possible exit to level 669.</p><br><p>Thanks.<br/>\n~ <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-bierre\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6155146); return false;\"><img alt=\"Dr Bierre\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=6155146&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334082\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=6155146)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-bierre\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6155146); return false;\">Dr Bierre</a></span></p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/entity-188\">Entity 188 - \"The Scomparsa\"</a>\" by Dr Bierre, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

    "title": "- \"The Macchina\"",
    "description": "<p><strong>The Macchina</strong> were an ancient species of partly cybernetic entities which were loosely related to <a href=\"/the-lost\">The Lost</a>. Due to circumstances which are as of yet unknown, this species went extinct around two-hundred years ago. Evidence of their culture, interactions, societal behaviors, and subsequently, their existence have been provided by The Lost and other parties.</p><br><p>What we know to be true about <strong>The Macchina</strong> is actually quite little. They seemed to be the most widely spread out race in The Backrooms previously to humans, having mastered the art of no-clipping to and from a variety of Levels. Their home resided in Level 2, having slowly evolved from an animalistic species into the sentient and highly advanced cybernetic race that they were previous to their extinction.</p><br><p>They made friendly contact with The Lost early in the group's starting years, and they were known to trade resources and share their knowledge about The Backrooms with them.</p><br><p>\"The creatures walk lightly, and with elegance. They know much more about this place than we do, although they do not claim to hold such knowledge.</p><br><p>They treat us kindly, for now. As such, it is only just to deliver such kindness in return. I wonder, however, where these beings come from. They seem to be connected with these walls\u2026 almost as though they were a part of them before.\u201d</p><br><p><strong>-Ancient Lost text on The Macchina.</strong></p><br><p>A variety of mechanisms that were used in Macchina suits.</p><br><p><strong>The Macchina</strong> were vaguely humanoid, but they enclosed themselves in large, metallic suits which they wore for the entirety of their lives. These suits had bulky, elaborate designs which utilized extremely advanced technology, which was not understood by anyone other than themselves. The species also welded small, human-like patterns into the front of their visors so they could share a similar appearance with The Lost, and not seem \"off putting\u201d.</p><br><p>The true form of <strong>The Macchina</strong> is incredibly unclear to modern historians. In the creature's culture, a member of the species was not considered \"alive\u201d until they had been put into their suits, and so depictions of their natural forms are exceedingly hard to come across as it was considered taboo to depict dead members of their society. The materials they would use to create these suits were gathered from places like Level 2, and they had almost completely stripped the Level clean of the rare resources which they used to create their cybernetic enhancements with towards the end of their reign of The Backrooms. However, it is unknown whether or not these creatures were \"born\" naturally, or manufactured in a more robotic sense.</p><br><p>In general, the species housed technology that was revolutionary for its time, and especially hard to replicate even in the modern Backrooms era. Their machinery may have been comparable to that seen in <a href=\"/the-frontrooms\">The Frontrooms</a>, but much more alien in nature. It is also believed that <strong>The Macchina</strong> used rudimentary forms of spears and pikes as weaponry when needed. Although the species <em>had</em> been working on an early version of what could be considered a \"gun\u201d\u2014 this being a small pipe that could launch flaming projectiles\u2014 the species deemed it too resource-heavy to bother using.</p><br><p>They had utilized a language that has yet to be translated into most languages by historians, but when The Lost arrived, they did learn to communicate in a crude form of Latin. Their writing used heavy emphasis on markings and small symbols, not dissimilar to Egyptian hieroglyphics. <a href=\"/entity-140\">Blanche</a> has since offered to try and translate the language using the knowledge of <a href=\"/level-906\">Level 906</a>, having been familiar with the race.</p><br><p>From what it seemed, <strong>The Macchina</strong> had a culture completely defined in The Backrooms. The race had never even been <em>outside</em> of The Backrooms itself, Having lived in The Backrooms for the entirety of the time that they were active. As such, when The Lost began to speak of their time in The Frontrooms, they became increasingly fascinated with the concept of this \"other world\u201d so to speak. Towards their disappearance, they had begun drawing large and magnificent tapestries of what seemed to be their depiction of environments in The Frontrooms, and would show this to newborn members of the species.</p><br><p>Some time around The Lost's arrival, <strong>The Macchina</strong> had begun to experience resource fatigue within Level 2, which is theorized to have been a defining factor in the disappearance of <strong>The Macchina</strong>. At their largest, the group could have had between one thousand and two thousand members. Towards The Lost\u2019s arrival, however, they began to drop into the hundreds.</p><br><p>\"They seem to believe that their offspring can only be created within the walls of <a href=\"/level-2\">The Second Area</a>. They have almost entirely relocated there, seeing its resources as almost sacred in nature.</p><br><p>I have consulted with the chiefs of their tribes, and they have expressed doubt over the future of their loved ones. They simply are reproducing at too fast a rate, and have too little equipment to continue creating their machinery. Every third child dies, lacking a suit for it to inhabit.</p><br><p>They have created such wonderful art and worlds with which we are lucky to visit\u2026 but at a steep cost. Perhaps, this cost will be too much.\u201d</p><br><p><strong>-The Lost\u2019s document of The Level 2 crisis.</strong></p><br><p>A surviving drawing of The Great Answer, drawn by an unknown Macchina.</p><br><p>In the last months of their existence, they began to speak of something they called \"The Great Answer\u201d. Scholars had claimed that a \"solution\" had arrived, solving their wildest questions as to the nature of their existence which had gone unsolved for centuries. They said that this could rescue them from their recent famine, and potentially give them enough resources to create more machinery for centuries. At one point, they even <em>declined resources</em> from The Lost, believing The Great Answer would supply them.</p><br><p>Soon they began to draw art of figures descending from bulbs of light within Level 2, reaching out to them in an almost biblical connotation.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> Only a small amount of time after faith of The Great Answer started to spread, would <strong>The Macchina</strong> disappear forever.</p><br><p>It is believed that the knowledge of such a place like The Frontrooms was inherently contradictory to everything the species had known up until that point in their lives. Knowing that The Backrooms was simply an imitation of a pre-existing place seemed to cause a species-wide existential hysteria, which may have lead to such a willing acceptance of The Great Answer. It is unknown who or what started spreading The Great Answer, or the exact nature of its knowledge, but it must have had detrimental effects to the species.</p><br><p>The remnants of a Macchina household.</p><br><p>The ruins left behind by <strong>The Macchina</strong> are extremely scarce, but provide a wealth of understanding related to their history. Still, as the backrooms has continued to expand since their disappearance, <strong>The Macchina's</strong> ruins remain hard to come by. To date, not a single intact settlement has been discovered.</p><br><p>When compared to other major species in The Backrooms, <strong>The Macchina</strong> disappeared relatively quickly. Some theorize that the group died off as a result of their fleeting resources, unable to adapt to the changes in their environment. Others theorize that The Great Answer did, in fact, ascend them to a higher level of being, perhaps even taking them to The Frontrooms itself.</p><br><p>Either way, their sudden extinction shocked The Lost, and caused the group to have a \"non-intervention\" policy for years to come.</p><br><p><strong>Interview 1337</strong><br/>\n<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Doctor Bierre<br/>\n<strong>Interviewee:</strong> Aulus of The Lost</p><br><p><strong>Bierre:</strong> So, are you ready to tell us about <strong>The Macchina</strong>?</p><br><p><strong>Aulus:</strong> I have not heard of them in\u2026 a long time. What do you wish to know?</p><br><p><strong>Bierre:</strong> We've heard from your other historians that they were fairly amicable. What was your personal experience with them?</p><br><p><em>Aulus smiles to himself.</em></p><br><p><strong>Aulus:</strong> They were scholars, artists, musicians\u2026 They created instead of destroyed. They were at times brighter minds than us, but yet they still knew so little of the world with which they inhabited.</p><br><p><strong>Aulus:</strong> In time, however, this lack of knowledge consumed them. We came from another world, and it scared them beyond belief. They wanted answers- a <em>god</em> to believe in, some sort of creator to explain such horrors\u2026</p><br><p><strong>Bierre:</strong> And what did they find? What was \"The Great Answer\"?</p><br><p><strong>Aulus:</strong> They found one, I suppose. We never did get to see it ourselves. Still, they were good to us\u2026 and I wish them well, regardless of where they are now.</p><br><p><strong>Aulus:</strong> Perhaps the things we see in this world can scare us. Perhaps there truly <em>is</em> no answer to the nature of our life. My faith has been tested ever since I have arrived here. For some, the only true \"answer\" is in death itself.</p><br><p>Thanks.<br/>\n~ <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-bierre\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6155146); return false;\"><img alt=\"Dr Bierre\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=6155146&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334082\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=6155146)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-bierre\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6155146); return false;\">Dr Bierre</a></span></p><br><p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/jamesmathurin/24200369906/in/dateposted/\">https://www.flickr.com/photos/jamesmathurin/24200369906/in/dateposted/</a> CC BY 2.0</p><br><p>\"Sketch of Figural Group for Ascension\" by Francis Augustus Lathrop, American, 1849 - 1909 is marked under CC0\u00a01.0.

    "description": "<p>Whenever they are encountered in the Frontrooms, Men in Black are never imagined to be anything other than human beings. They are mysterious men, often dressed in black, who silence witnesses to so-called Unidentified Flying Objects and terrorize researchers of UFOs and esoteric subjects. Any genuine strangeness is remembered only after they depart.</p><br><p>No one has ever reported meeting a group larger than three, with pairs being common and single individuals encountered the most often.</p><br><p>Some witnesses describe them as cadaverous and devoid of body hair. Others see them as swarthy. There is always something slightly \"off\" about their appearance and mannerisms.\u00a0</p><br><p>Another curious trait is that the clothes that the MiB are wearing look as if they had purchased them in a clothing store ten minutes beforehand, and even the bottom of their shoes seem unwalked-on in appearance, no matter the weather. Everything is always brand new.</p><br><p>The Men in Black received official United States Air Force recognition in a confidential memo sent to all commands that began: <em>\"Information, not verifiable, has reached Hq USAF that persons claiming to represent the Air Force or other Defense establishments have contacted civilians who have sighted unidentified flying objects.\"</em> The letter recounted how one imposter demanded and received photos belonging to a private citizen and another bogus officer, in full Air Force uniform, assembled local police and other citizens to warn them not to speak about their recent UFO sightings.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup></p><br><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>MiB Quote</strong></p><br><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>\"What happens when you shoot an angel?\"</em></p><br><p>Behaviors are where things get really interesting, really fast.</p><br><p>The MiB often intimidates a witness <strong>before</strong> that person has a chance to tell anyone else about seeing a UFO. In a surprising turn of events, they describe the UFO sighting to the witness in astonishing detail and know when the witness is lying or hiding something. They are aware of any video, photos, or tangible proof that might \"upset the balance of the multiverse.\"</p><br><p>They warn the witness to keep silent and confiscate any physical evidence. Victims speak of being unable to think or react rationally until after the enigmatic visitors depart. To some, this \"deer in the headlights\" confusion suggests altered states of consciousness or subliminal hypnotic techniques.</p><br><p>Men in Black appear and disappear at will. Their black automobiles often vanish down dead-end roads. These Cadillacs and Jaguars, reported in the United States and Europe, respectively, are usually vintage models that belong in a showroom.</p><br><p>Psychics from Earth trapped here <sup>(how did they not predict that coming?)</sup> find their occult abilities growing sharper and stronger day by day. According to Alayna, an evolved Faceling from the distant future now stationed at the Harbinger Heights region of <a href=\"/level-246\">Level 246</a>, this is because the Earth is under the influence of metaphysical suppression due to the concentration of humans found there. This inherent filter permeates every being in the Frontrooms, native or visitor, and greatly reduces many supernatural abilities.</p><br><p>The suppressive anti-psychic field does not exist in the Backrooms because humans do not belong here.

    "description": "<p><strong>Entity 192</strong>, commonly known as a \"swindlebird,\" is a pigeon-adjacent avifauna found in many forested levels. It survives by distracting predators using a variety of evolutional adaptations.</p><br><p><strong>Entity 192</strong> is known for its extreme prevalence and relative intelligence. On multiple occasions, swindlebirds have shown the ability to solve rudimentary puzzles.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> This resourcefulness, along with their eagerness to copulate, has allowed swindlebirds to spread quickly across the backrooms. Their stomachs can process a wide variety of fruits and grains, allowing them to instantly make themselves home in any new environment. They have also appeared in <a href=\"/level-11\">Level 11</a> as an invasive pest, much like the pigeons of the frontrooms.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup></p><br><p><strong>Entity 192</strong>'s diet consists entirely of scavenged berries and grains. Because its habitat spans environments with vastly different flora, its digestive system is incredibly durable. Plenty of common poisons are nothing more than a passing breeze to a swindlebird. However, if there is a substance it cannot handle, it can easily vomit on command.</p><br><p><strong>Entity 192</strong> nests are incredibly unique in comparison to those of most other birds. Instead of high up in a tree, these are built closer to the ground. From a distance, one may take the appearance of a stone, or pile of leaves. However, if you know what you're looking for, you may spot some holes poking through. Further investigation will reveal it to be a mere curtain of scavenged debris. <strong>Entity 192</strong> will construct small tents of sticks, cover them with environmental chaff, and leave a small opening for it to squeeze through. These nests are where the chicks are raised, where the birds sleep, and where extra food is hoarded.</p><br><p><strong>Entity 192</strong> is actually the name assigned to a genus. There are four distinct species of swindlebird, easily identified by their coloration. Each one of these has its own method for redirecting predators, and has developed unique physical characteristics to support their technique. They have been grouped together as a singular entity because of their similar skeletal structure, migration, diet, way of raising children, nesting practices, and general survival strategy.</p><br><p>Red swindlebirds, as shown in the image above, have a large feather attached to the back of their scalp. Using its three leg joints, a red specimen's feather can be moved along at a perfectly smooth pace, removing any trace of gait. This makes it hard for predators to identify it as an animal, and therefore any chance of it being prey.</p><br><p>The green swindlebird is approximately as common as the red variety, although it appears less often in Level 11. Its technique for danger redirection relies on its distinctive beak, which appears elongated and abnormally straight. With the specialized shape of this beak, along with its forked tongue, the green swindlebird can emit ultrasonic screeches in an attempt to scare away the opposition.</p><br><p>Purple swindlebirds are distinctly more rare than the first two subspecies, most likely due to the relative danger of their strategy. They have larger, more reflective eyes, which it uses to disorient predators. This brings a few problems. Firstly, the reflective membrane underneath the cornea only makes a difference at night, which requires them to be nocturnal. Secondly, their bright eyes often <em>attract</em> predators instead of <em>repelling</em> them. Due to the increased danger of simply existing, purple swindlebirds breed even faster than the other variants. Their offspring can survive without parental guidance as well.</p><br><p>The rarest and most elusive variant of <strong>Entity 192</strong>. Much of our information comes from a single specimen in M.E.G. custody.<br/>\nIts appearance can be described as similar to a typical parrot, with the same head shape, feather texture, and beak. Although it may appear completely ordinary, there is certainly something special to this kind of swindlebird.<br/>\nThe outermost feathers of the blue swindlebird are coated in an unidentified hallucinogenic substance, known to cause slight delirium in entities and wanderers that make skin contact. This effect is incredibly fast-acting, meaning that most predators that attempt to attack a blue swindlebird will be repelled before it can be wounded.</p><br><p><strong>EDIT:</strong> On 06/05/2015, the M.E.G. received a report of an abnormally powerful blue swindlebird on <a href=\"/level-2\">level 2</a>.</p><br><p><a href=\"/entity-7\">Further investigation</a> as to its origins are underway.</p><br><p>Although sightings of \"colored pigeons\" were reported for multiple years prior, the first verifiable appearance of <strong>Entity 192</strong> was on 08/14/2008 in Level 11. More started appearing shortly after, and made themselves at home. <strong>Entity 192</strong> is now a permanent staple of the city.</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/entity-192\">Entity 192 - \"Swindlebirds\"</a>\" by Aether48, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

    "description": "<p>Entity 193, more commonly referred to as \"Cindy\", is a singular entity known for its friendliness towards Wanderers, ability to morph its appearance, and ability to perfectly no-clip from level to level at will. Information on Cindy is highly valuable due to its ability to travel from level to level at will. Research is being done by several M.E.G. operatives regarding Cindy's efficacious no-clip technique, in hopes of making the arduous and hazardous task of traversing through The Backrooms much simpler and safer.</p><br><p>Cindy is very friendly and is even known to accompany wanderers on their journey until it loses interest. Despite this, Cindy is a fairly reserved entity, and it will not interact with wanderers unless they begin the interaction first.</p><br><p>This entity is docile, only attacking when feeling aggressed, so no special precautions need be taken around this being. However, if Cindy feels at all threatened, it will usually just no-clip away from the source of its stress. In the rare situation that the entity cannot safely exit the area, it may strangle or throw the attacker until they are incapacitated.</p><br><p>Cindy can change its appearance to disguise itself as one's first love, best friend, or close relative in an attempt to put Wanderers more at ease when interacting with it. It is believed that numerous past experiences with Wanderers who were frightened by the entity's original form caused Cindy to adapt to be less threatening in appearance, in order to evoke positive interactions with Wanderers. Over time, Cindy may return to it's original form around Wanderers it feels can be trusted.</p><br><p>Cindy is a highly approachable entity. It is even willing to transport Wanderers<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> in exchange for all sorts of goods. It is thought that Cindy may simply collect or store the items it receives from trading out of curiosity, since it cannot consume food or put other objects of trade to much use. Trade with this entity can be difficult, as it cannot speak, though it does understand many languages. It will instead point or gesture to communicate with others.</p><br><p>For some strange reason, Cindy seems to never spend more than 24 hours in any one location. As of now, there is much speculation surrounding the reason for this behavior, but no reasonable conclusion has been made.</p><br><p>The entity's given, apparently unfitting nickname (Cindy), originated from a voice-recorded interview with an anonymous B.N.T.G. member, from which there is an excerpt from in the <strong>discovery</strong> section.</p><br><p>When not in a disguise, entity 193 is a tall, humanoid creature with a slouching posture, reaching at a height of about 7 feet (213 centimeters). It has very long, thin limbs and legs that resemble that of a dog's. Its body is covered in a smooth, plastic-like, white material, colored black where its joints meet (i.e. shoulders, elbows, mid-torso, knees, and neck). Cindy's face consists only of two small, black, sunken eyes and sharp cheekbones.</p><br><p>The entity can often be described as somewhat robotic in appearance. Cindy's physiological makeup is still unknown, but the M.E.G. is still learning about its ability to no-clip seamlessly from level to level, and its somatic configuration is largely responsible for its highly difficult method of transportation.</p><br><p>Cindy's first confirmed sighting was in 2012 when an anonymous B.N.T.G. member first arrived to The Backrooms, and reported seeing his high school sweetheart, named Cindy, walking around the halls of level 0. Overlooking the fact that she could not speak, he believed the entity was actually the person he knew due to his disoriented state of mind. Cindy then began leading him to the Manila room, a journey that took an estimated 4-5 hours, before shifting back into its original form upon their arrival at the room. It then departed after giving the man, in his own words, a \"quick wave goodbye\".</p><br><p>Excerpt from voice-recorded interview with the B.N.T.G. member:</p><br><p>\"I was beginning to feel hopeless, trapped in what I can only describe as the most off-putting, endless maze I've ever been in, only to see someone very familiar. I was both shocked and elated to see another person after countless hours of being alone, let alone a person I knew! It was my first girlfriend, Cindy, back from my sophomore year of high school\u2026 she looked like she hadn't aged a day since I last saw her!</p><br><p>I remember her very vividly. She was probably one of the best things that had ever happened to me. However, the good times that I never expected to end ground to a halt when my parents decided the school I was attending at the time wasn't good enough for me, because the crime rate was high and the teachers there\u2026 just weren't very good at their job. So I was forced to transfer somewhere else against my will. I wasn't allowed to keep in contact with any of my old friends either, mainly because my mother thought they were a 'bad influence'\u2026 and, wouldn\u2019t you know it, this included Cindy. I was devastated, we had been best friends since elementary school, it took me years to tell her how I really felt\u2026 no one knew me like she did. When I told her the bad news, she gave me the warmest hug and said that everything would be okay. She was always so much stronger than me\u2026 and so much more attractive *<em>laughter</em>*. Seeing her here, in this awful place, made me feel less alone, but also mad that she had to experience this hellhole.</p><br><p>I ran up to her quickly, then tried to explain my situation. She was so calm and such a kind aura about her, I was so happy to see another living thing that I didn't even notice that she hadn't said a single word to me the entire time we were together. Instead, she pointed in front of her and began walking, so I started following her. Which sounds really stupid now that I think about it, but I was unbelievably desperate. She guided me to a room with files on how to no-clip, and that's how I ended up getting here. As I was about to leave, I turned around to ask if she was gonna come with me, only to find she was gone\u2026 and there was this huge monster standing there instead. I was shocked half to death by that\u2026 that thing that I thought just took my Cindy away from me again. I didn\u2019t know what to do, except to just\u2026 stare at it in fright. It didn\u2019t lunge out to get me like I thought it would. It only gave me a quick wave goodbye and then just\u2026 walked away.\"</p><br><p><span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/karmaaisntavailable\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7442080); return false;\"><img alt=\"Karmaaisntavailable\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7442080&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334075\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7442080)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/karmaaisntavailable\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7442080); return false;\">Karmaaisntavailable</a></span><br/>\n\"An Empty Room\" by Orin Zebest is licensed with CC BY-SA 2.0.

    "title": "- \"The Crystal Sisters\"",
    "description": "<p>The Crystal Sisters are a now-deceased group of entities that used to reside in <a href=\"/level-197\">Level 197</a>. Each sister resided in a zone of Level 197, thought to relate to each of their demeanors and current conditions.</p><br><p><em>They were so nice. I miss them dearly.</em></p><br><p>There were three sisters, each one of them made from the crystal of the zone they resided in. More information is held below.</p><br><p>The Crystal Sisters were all radically different in behavior.</p><br><p>The Sister that resided in the Turquoise Zone introduced herself to all wanderers as Vivian, and everyone who interacted with her described Vivian as, \"one of the most lovely entities in the Backrooms.\" She would provide wanderers with distilled water, rest, and hospitality to all that entered. She would make conversation very interesting, with her stories having high amounts of emotion, description, and general entertainment.</p><br><p>She would talk about her family, her past, and how her zone came to be. All wanderers who listened to this story were affected in some way emotionally, with most showing empathy to Vivian.</p><br><p>Vivian would consistently give depressed or struggling people hugs, encouraging them to go forward. Many who received said hugs felt better, saying that, \"It didn't help immediately, but it just\u2026 felt like someone was there, you know? Like there was someone who cared for you.\" Many people stay in the Turquoise Zone to see Meditation Cove, and hope that Vivian will return one day.</p><br><p><em>Vivian was the best of us. It didn't matter who it was; she would care for them all the same. Even when pushing me out of the dimension and into the void, she seemed reluctant and wanted to think twice about what she was doing. She is who I miss the most.</em></p><br><p><em>Here is a drawing that my fellow whispers have drawn up. They're surprisingly helpful when it comes to things that are foreign to me.</em></p><br><p><em>Hey, are you making fun of us?</em></p><br><p><em>Yeah, that's kinda mean!</em></p><br><p><em>I jest, I jest.</em></p><br><p>Ita was the Amethyst Sister, and was always very sickly. Those who got close to her, with or without any gas mask, would succumb to illness almost immediately. She would seem to hate how no wanderer could get close to her, and would usually hit herself or scratch at her body. When wanderers would try to calm her down, she would not listen and scream to leave her alone. Her screams would break gas masks and bust eardrums, and it was not recommended to try and talk her out of self-harm.</p><br><p>Ita, when dormant, would always try to end her own life. These means were vast and some were deemed too descriptive for some, though a few were: her slamming her head against a cavern wall, particularly on a crystal shard, trying to break her own neck, and scratching at her chest to try and pull out her \"organs.\" When walking through the halls after an attempt on her own life, she would sob or tiredly call out for her sisters or \"brother.\" It is currently unknown definitively who the brother to the Sisters are, but it is widely agreed that <a href=\"/entity-297\">the Dark Sovereign</a> is their sibling.</p><br><p>Since she would try and stay away from wanderers, not much more is known about her.</p><br><p><em>Ita was in so much mental pain from her physical condition. She was always malnourished, thinner than a bone, and hunched over in some regard. I wish I could have helped her. Even though I never talked to her, I feel as if I may have been able to help. At least I can live well knowing that she wished to see me again. In time, Ita. We will see each other again very soon. I will give you a hug that no one was ever able to give you.</em></p><br><p><em>She looks\u2026 so sad.</em></p><br><p><em>Can we help her? I want to help her!</em></p><br><p><em>Patience. Trust me, I wish to help my sister as much as anyone else would want to. No one was there for Ita. No one could ever heal her pain. Her sisters could not reach her, humans could not help her, and sadly you whispers could do nothing but tell her that everything was okay.</em></p><br><p><em>Would that not be enough?</em></p><br><p><em>Yeah, we like to try as much as we can!</em></p><br><p><em>Telling someone that something will be okay is only part of the process. Physical affection works much more. That is why when I bring them back, I will hug her first.</em></p><br><p>Kilian was the sister who resided in the Ruby Zone. Always angry, she would kill any wanderer she saw on sight and throw their bodies into the pits where Crimson Fortresses now reside. Kilian would always be spotted ripping chunks out of her body and hurling them into the walls of the caverns, with the pieces she ripped off re-growing on her body soon after. She would slam the ground to create crystal spike traps, tear down walls for caverns where entities now reside, and generally destroy the terrain of her zone.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup></p><br><p>She would constantly scream at wanderers to get out of the Ruby Zone and would even chase them away. Wanderers would reportedly sweat madly when running away and become heavily dehydrated, usually collapsing from exhaustion. She would kill victims quickly, and when leaving the scene their bodies would reanimate into a random entity.</p><br><p>With Kilian being the most hostile of the three sisters, no more information can be gathered other than what could be heard echoing down the halls.</p><br><p><em>Kilian was\u2026 an enigma, to say the least. She was always so angry, and is probably what influences some of my thoughts and behaviors as well. She was a large part in creating this little plane of existence, and her Fortresses still stand strong. Maybe she was dealing with something internally. Maybe people just misunderstood her. I will never understand myself, but in the time to come I hope I can help her calm. It's for the best.</em></p><br><p><em>I think we drew her quite well!</em></p><br><p><em>Yes. You captured her look very well.</em></p><br><p><em>Why\u2026 <strong>was</strong> she so angry all the time?</em></p><br><p><em>If only I knew the answer to that question. She seems like a nice person, though.</em></p><br><p><em>How can someone so angry be nice?</em></p><br><p><em>It's possible. They just show their affection in ways that are different to others. You little voices have things to learn\u2026</em></p><br><p>The Crystal Sisters were all made of polygonal crystals which gave them a humanoid appearance. Vivian was the largest of the three sisters, having a much bulkier body type. Ita was the smallest, being the shortest and the thinnest. Kilian was somewhere in between, having a fit body type and being in the middle of height.</p><br><p>The sisters all had a crown atop their heads, each made of a different material.</p><br><p>As of now, no drawings are able to be given. An artist is working on giving a rendition of the sisters, as no images were ever taken of their appearance.</p><br><p>The Crystal Sisters were discovered in 2003 by an abundance of wanderers entering Level 197. As expected, Vivian was the first sister found on 14 Feb 2003, and many were eager to stay with her. Ita was found soon after on 01 Mar 2003, though many stayed away from her due to her infectious properties. Kilian was discovered on 21 Nov 2003, as many wanderers could not find a suitable source of gas masks until early November.</p><br><p>No detailed reports of Ita or Kilian exist, and many submissions for Vivian were repetitive about their experience. We have found it necessary to only include the dates of when they were <a href=\"/whispers-from-the-dark\">discovered.</a></p><br><p>Written by <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/navyeod-24\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(2945263); return false;\"><img alt=\"NavyEOD_24\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=2945263&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334082\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=2945263)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/navyeod-24\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(2945263); return false;\">NavyEOD_24</a></span><br/>\nThank you to <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/poliacci\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7863813); return false;\"><img alt=\"Poliacci\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7863813&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334082\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7863813)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/poliacci\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7863813); return false;\">Poliacci</a></span> for the amazing drawings of the sisters!</p><br><p><a href=\"/navyeod-24\">Rise Against the Hive</a></p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/entity-194\">Entity 194</a>\" by NavyEOD_24, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

Most, if not all, are incomprehensible to humans and other living vessels.</p><br><p>Endless/Nameless seems to fluctuate in mass and colour based on current atmospheric pressure and the ratio of diatomic gases in the air, respectively.</p><br><p>Unfortunately, the Entity is currently undergoing a \"Clustural Shift\", in which it simultaneously exists in more than one Cluster, which is problematic for its realital stability.</p><br><p><tt>I am Alpha and Omega</tt></p><br><p><tt>The beginning and the end</tt></p><br><p><tt>Rhythmic dance of constant changes</tt></p><br><p><tt>Time you wish you could have spent</tt></p><br><p>Remnants of Endless/Nameless remain in levels that used to be inhabited by it, with these remnants being embedded into surfaces touched by the entity. Currently, The M.E.G has been keeping an eye on these remnants since they have been observed to be growing, with bulbs recently observed to be forming.</p><br><p>Endless/Nameless are considered a bad omen, particularly on Level 11, where an instance showing up after a new Wanderer has entered the level is seen as a sign that they should leave immediately. If a Wanderer does not vacate the premise, they will die in a fantastical and improbable way that applies to the current area. Instances of Endless/Nameless tend to bring along with it disaster, the most notable being the Great Molasses Flood of Level 11.</p><br><p>It is also of note that witnesses have reported similar predatory behaviors to those of <a href=\"/entity-10\">Skin Stealers</a>. However, any relation between the two is presently unconfirmed.</p><br><p>Focus on the Endless/Nameless is undesired by the entities. They will try to distract you with meaningless minutiae, memetic hazards that interfere with solipsism and heuristic processes. Do not get distracted, as even a slight distraction could be a fatal mistake.</p><br><p>Most instances of Endless/Nameless will pursue their victims and then <sub>nothing remains</sub></p><br><p>While of course, sightings of this entity will vary, the one thing in common with reports is that the entity seems to have a recurring 'rotting vegetable' smell. Most entities are also repelled by the Endless/Nameless for a currently unknown reason, however the current theory is that the rotten stench is putrid enough to ward off predators.</p><br><p>This entity is capable of producing agents, beings <span class=\"red\">contaminated</span> by its touch. You can not trust anyone, all those who have been touched constitute a <span class=\"red\">latent</span> danger. They try to disguise, they smile but they are not happy, look at their eyes, look at the <span class=\"red\">void</span>.</p><br><p>Little can ever be seen of the entity, as, most commonly, it dissipates rather quickly. However, small glances are possible, as is viewing from a distance. The entity appears as a gray humanoid, devoid of recognizable features.</p><br><p><tt>I am <em>nothing</em>, <sub>but</sub> with <strong>nothing</strong>, <sup>what</sup> can be <sub>made</sub>?</tt><br/>\n<tt>these eyes that once <sub>belonged to me</sub> are no more mine to <sup>keep</sup></tt><br/>\n<tt>i have <sup>gambled</sup> all my riches and i pay the <sub>penalty</sub></tt><br/>\n<tt>torn to <sup>void</sup> by my wrongdoing</tt><br/>\n<tt>now void of <sub>ecstasy</sub></tt></p><br><p>This entity was discovered on 2/4/2012.The first instance of this entity was rumored to be found on <a href=\"/level-27\">Level 27</a>; the Wanderer who discovered it died almost instantly from an entity attack accompanied by the aforementioned 'rotting vegetable' smell.</p><br><p>[begin log]</p><br><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>The following transcript details an interaction between Endless/Nameless and Researcher A.

    "description": "<p><strong>Entity 196</strong> resembles a young boy appearing to be around 16 years of age with pale skin, dark hair, and brown eyes. <strong>Entity 196</strong>'s most notable feature is burn scar that covers it's left cheek and upper torso. The entity can often be found walking about <a href=\"/level-1\">Level 1</a>, and it will cause any wanderer that comes into contact with it to experience cardiac arrest. No feeding patterns have been observed, and the bodies of <strong>Entity 196</strong>'s victims are always left untouched. Because of the danger of studying it, not much more information is known.</p><br><p><strong>To:</strong> Overseer Andrew<br/>\n<strong>From:</strong> Henry Sunter<br/>\n<strong>Subject:</strong> New Note (Level 1)<br/>\n<strong>03.13.2021</strong></p><br><p>We found a new note in <a href=\"/level-1\">Level 1</a>; this one is much longer than the others. I can't be sure, but I have a hunch it relates the the entity that you've been obsessing over lately. I've attached a transcription of the note to this email.</p><br><p><em>Henry Sunter, M.E.G.</em></p><br><p><em>There once was a child, born in the twisting passageways. His first sight was the grey walls. The concrete that had crumbled in the corner. A dark stain, marring the dirty white ceiling. This same sight was his mother's last. As he looked up for the very first time, he could see his entire world, and he knew instinctively that it was his home.</em></p><br><p><em>The walls provided for him. Feeding him. Clothing him. For he was their son too. He never learned how to talk, for the walls could not teach him, but that was okay. The walls spoke for him. The walls protected him from the entities that had taken so many in the past, for the walls could control them. All but one \u2014 humans.</em></p><br><p><em>The walls had always been wary of humans. They were foreign. Other. Sure, the boy was one of them, but he was different. He was created here. He was not from the outside. Perhaps the humans weren't all bad, the walls thought. After all, the humans brought them the boy. And so, the walls allowed the humans to stay. The walls even let the humans get close to the boy.</em></p><br><p><em>The walls allowed the boy to stay in a nearby commune. <a href=\"/the-m-e-g\">These humans</a> were nice. These humans cared for the boy. But, this did not last. More humans came. <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/cartographers-republic\">The ones in purple</a>. They attacked, burning indiscriminately. But the first humans did not save the boy. They didn't even try. Instead they fought back. Matching the purple soldiers' cruelty. In this fight, the boy was almost lost.</em></p><br><p><em>The walls bent and twisted, allowing a shelter for the boy as the outside world was reduced to ash. After this, the walls knew that they could never let the humans near the boy again, for next time they might not get so lucky.</em></p><br><p><em>And so the boy continued to walk. The scars from the fire a constant reminder. The boy didn't understand the wall's way of protecting him from humans. It almost made him sad to see their dead eyes staring back at him. But he trusted the walls. He knew that it was necessary. He didn't need the humans anyway, he eventually realized. He had all that he needed right where he was. He had someone who cared about him. And then in the cracks in the concrete, and stains on the floor, it almost felt as though the walls were smiling.</em></p><br><p><strong>To:</strong> Henry Sunter<br/>\n<strong>From:</strong> Overseer Andrew<br/>\n<strong>Subject:</strong> re: New Note (Level 1)<br/>\n<strong>03.13.2021</strong></p><br><p>Thank you for this. It does seem to match M.E.G. historical records, even though we swept that one under the rug pretty well. Of course, there's no way to know who wrote this note, or any of the other notes in Level 1 for that matter.</p><br><p>He stops typing. Looking over the note for what feels like the hundredth time, searching for anything he'd missed.</p><br><p>I'm going out in the morning. If there's some way; any way that we can communicate with this kid, it could be the key we've been looking for. It could be our way out.</p><br><p><em>Andrew</em></p><br><p><strong>Author:</strong><br/>\n<span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/cutthebirch\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7000329); return false;\"><img alt=\"CutTheBirch\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7000329&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334082\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7000329)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/cutthebirch\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7000329); return false;\">CutTheBirch</a></span><br/>\n<a href=\"/cutthebirch\">Author Page</a></p><br><p><strong>Images:</strong><br/>\n<a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/733478011780988958/875092143725760572/image0.png\">image0</a> by <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/soyshamoy\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7438051); return false;\"><img alt=\"SoyShamoy\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7438051&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334082\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7438051)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/soyshamoy\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7438051); return false;\">SoyShamoy</a></span> is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0</p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/entity-195\">Entity 195</a> | Entity 196 | <a href=\"/entity-197\">Entity 197</a> \u00bb</p><br>",

    "description": "<p><strong>Entity 198</strong>, or The Plush Dino, is the sole Entity which inhabits Level 18. The Entity resembles a plush filled dinosaur who is capable of movement. The dinosaur typically stays in a dormant state, and will make no reaction to movements. However, whenever it senses someone who is in a distressed state on Level 18, it will enter its \"active state\". In this state, its textile \"skin\" becomes pink, and it grows a pair of legs, which are also made of textile covering.</p><br><p>Once finished converting to its active state, which takes about 20 seconds, it will begin to seek out the individual which experienced distress. Once <strong>Entity 198</strong> locates the individual in question, it will begin to help guide them around. It will typically wander in a joyful motion, and will take breaks often. Sometimes, it may beg to be cuddled, or else held. It appears to sleep, and will choose to do so. It requires no sustenance, though it can eat food if given. It is known for being very appreciative, and will always act joyful and thankful in the event it is given anything. It is incapable of speech, however, it is very capable of speaking through actions.</p><br><p><strong>Entity 198</strong> was discovered when Overseer-C was wandering on <a href=\"/level-4\">Level 4</a>, and accidentally stumbled upon Level 18. From there, he nearly turned around and left, but instead encountered <strong>Entity 198</strong>.

    "description": "<p><span style=\"font-size:110%;\"><span class=\"customFont\">Entity 200 are my robot friends. I made them all on my own and im really happy about them. I like to play games with them like city and house. I remember when I would play those games back at school with my frends. I hope they will come and see me here.</span></span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:110%;\"><span class=\"customFont\">My favorite one is named Tedison. He is the one with the smiley face in the picture. Tedison is also best friends with Bob. Bob is cool too but he is kinda mean to the others sometimes. There is also Cate, Hary, Sam, and Nugget. Well theres also Clyde and Sue and uh theres a lot of them.</span></span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:110%;\"><span class=\"customFont\">Each one of them have their own lives. Sometimes their arms or legs fall off but thats okay because I can always fix them. One has wheels for feet which I think is awsome. I even made one that looks like a dog that has a big cotton ball on it with a little red nose. I named him Bean like my old dog.<br/></span></span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:110%;\"><span class=\"customFont\">All of them are my friends here. Some of them are nice to me while some can be rude. Some of them remind me of people from school and at home. I havent been to school in a while I hope they havent forgotten about me.</span></span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:110%;\"><span class=\"customFont\">I tried to get them to play race cars but they didnt like it. Sams arm fell off and I had to tape it back on. I also accidentaly broke one of the springs on Tedison and caused it to be bent. I dont want to play race cars with them again because they got hurt.</span></span></p><br><p>this is what bean looks like</p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:110%;\"><span class=\"customFont\">I dont know what this means. I would ask my mom but I cant find her anywhere.</span></span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:110%;\"><span class=\"customFont\">I found some suplies and made these. They are made out of foam, buttons, wood, and cotton bals. I gave some of them faces. Theres some other things they are made with but I couldnt find enough to give all of them ears and arms.</span></span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:110%;\"><span class=\"customFont\">I keep these with me and will always want to keep them. I promised them that I will never lose them.</span></span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:110%;\"><span class=\"customFont\">Play with them. Their favorit game is city. That is when I pretend they live in a city and each one has a job and drives cars.</span></span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:110%;\"><span class=\"customFont\">Loose or break them. I ran out of stuff to make them with and I dont want them to go missing.</span></span><br/>\n<br/></p><br><p><br/>\nHello, we are a group of people who want to help you and your friends.

    "title": "- \"Blue-Ringed Deerlings\"",
    "description": "<p>Blue-ringed deerlings are omnivorous, tetrapod scavengers that thrived in the forests and woodlands of exterior levels. They were initially called \"pale sheep\" by the Chinese-speaking explorers and marked as a symbol of fertile soil.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> However, research has shown that the entity shares more biological similarities to the Cervidae family, save for various features including tarsus bones and claws on all four of its limbs.</p><br><p>Deerling sightings were common in the early days of pre-MEG settlement, especially during times of loss and grieving.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup> They were nearly hunted to extinction by the Second Great Wave of settlers in 2012, who described them as \"freaky-looking\" and ill-fit for the climate of a proper settlement. The general trend of setting traps for stray deerlings was popularized by Director Indiza and urged on by MEG upper wings, who recognized the versatility of the creature's vibrant hide. Due to increased human activity in the Backrooms following 2014, the deerling population has expanded into a wider variety of level environments. They have also since been re-associated with more sinister interpretations, after various ill-fated encounters in the subsequent years.</p><br><p><tt>Fig.1</tt> depicts one of the first sightings of an instance of Entity 201 in an interior level.</p><br><p>The head of a blue-ringed deerling bears two perked ears with rabbit-like pinnas from which emerge white, web-like growths when within range of prey. Its body is translucent in color, being pale grey or white under natural sunlight and glowing blue-green in fluorescent light. While idle, faint circular ringed patterns can be spotted on its skin. These patterns brighten when the deerling is snaring its prey or feeling threatened.</p><br><p><tt>The blue-ringed deerling is extremely toxic.</tt><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p><br><p><tt>Just by looking at its main food sources \u2014 <a href=\"/entity-57\">leech adders</a>, <a href=\"/entity-16\">nguithr'xurhs</a>, and the occasional carcass of a <a href=\"/entity-365\">sightless seer</a> as a delicacy \u2014 it is no mistake that the brightly colored blue marks on its fur are an indication of great warning. Any physical contact with the creature runs the risk of falling victim to the potent toxin sapped from its prey via digestion. The neurotoxin takes only half an hour to completely neutralize the human nervous system, inducing paralysis followed by an excruciating death.</tt></p><br><p><tt>As of current, there exists no cure.</tt></p><br><p>When approaching the entity, any creatures, including humans, risk becoming ensnared in its halo effect. This is marked by the glowing of webs sprung from the entity's ears, forming a halo-like ring around their head, like a malformed dreamcatcher. The tactic appears to be a favored method in immobilizing non-human prey, paired in sly conjunction with their venom to quickly reduce the most troublesome of meals to a cold cadaver. Likewise, wanderers in this state will become entranced, losing control of their body while experiencing vivid hallucinations from a foreign perspective. Based on eyewitness accounts and survivors, it is hypothesized that these perspectives belong to the past victims of Entity 201, with many profiles matching that of late wanderers who are known to have succumbed from blue-ringed deerling venom.</p><br><p>Blue-ringed deerlings are deemed low on the entity threat scale, as reports of \"close calls\" with deerling encounters far supersede actual records of lethal interaction. There has yet to be a case of a deerling actively chasing down an adult wanderer, as the creature's hunting patterns generally err more on the side of opportunism. Most deerlings that settle near civilization break away into cover upon being openly observed, resulting in the overwhelmingly low-quality archive of available image files.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')\">3</a></sup></p><br><p>Despite their unassumingly gaunt appearance, blue-ringed deerlings have been observed engaging in unexpected feats of acrobatics. They can be agile when the situation calls for it, known to scale the walls and ceilings of fenced-in settlements in spite of twig-thin limbs and unsteady locomotion. They have also been sighted crossing the surface of lakes and rivers, suggesting that either the blue-ringed deerling\u2019s weight is vastly disproportional to its body mass, or that this is merely one of the countless illogicalities of the Backrooms.</p><br><p>Deerlings seem to concern themselves plenty with man-made locations. They are reputed to possess a curious streak, as evidenced by the surplus amounts of footage depicting blue-ringed deerlings trashing MEG machinery. It is heavily discouraged for settlers to leave out fresh game and the recently deceased in areas known to house a high density of the deerling populace, as they have been known to feast on both animal and human carcasses.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-4\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')\">4</a></sup> Despite mainly targeting smaller entities, the deerling's appetite extends to anything it can fit in its mouth. In rare tragic cases, this includes human infants.</p><br><p>After the aforementioned events in The Inland and various illicit scandals in the months thereafter, local archivist Ellis Quinsay headed outside the borders of the settlement without alerting the rest of their team. At around sundown, Quinsay encountered a grazing blue-ringed deerling just outside the wire fence surrounding the settlement and ducked under the fencing to approach it. The creature was quickly alerted to the archivist\u2019s presence, and what followed is described by Quinsay upon their return to Base Psi.</p><br><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Up here, the wind was wild today.</em></p><br><p><em>I was traveling further up the mountains to snatch some bears; you know how it makes a morning on the weekends. Welcome sunlight poured through the canopy brighter than descending saints, and bulbs of great jade pearls fell from the trees. The timbers grew just a bit more elastic in the absence of the rain, the boulders just a bit more willing to budge. I pushed through \u2014 and lo and behold, the forest was a complete breeze, lots of grand clearings letting me walk easy. I had a bag of fish and mushrooms over my shoulder, and I was in a hell of a mood, whistling a tune Daisy taught me. Just a few more steps and I would be back round the border. Couldn\u2019t wait to get back down there tonight. They were gonna love my catches, \u2018specially Daisy. I was gonna head back and tell her Daddy\u2019s made a grand fortune and not in credit, no\u2026</em></p><br><p><em>Up here, the wind was wild today\u2026</em></p><br><p>And then, of course, it went on. It could have been a dozen or two dozen times before I snapped out of it. Or it snapped me out of it, I hardly know. But when I came to, the sky was still drizzling with rain, the burst of endorphins was fading from my system, and the deerling had turned and trotted back into the forest.</p><br><p>Back then, I didn\u2019t think anything of it. I mean, I\u2019m remembering it now, how many times the scene looped in on itself, but in the moment, it didn't occur to me; not at all. I was just heading down the mountains, holding a bag with no weight at all, light-footed and giddy. It was like I could walk for another hundred, hundreds of feet and it wouldn\u2019t slow me. There was no sense of weariness. But then it ended, and I wasn\u2019t Daisy\u2019s daddy. I was just Ellis.</p><br><p>Please excuse me.</p><br><p>Archivist Quinsay returned to Base Psi but has rejected further psychological intervention. The profile of the wanderer featured in Quinsay\u2019s hallucinations has been identified as Jacob Marseille, who had gone missing off the trail of The Inland twelve months ago.</p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/entity-200\">Entity 200</a> | Entity 201 | <a href=\"/entity-202\">Entity 202</a> \u00bb</p><br><p><a href=\"/entity-315\">Entity 315</a></p><br><p><a href=\"/coming-soon\">The Inland Hub</a></p><br><p><a href=\"/object-201\">Object 201</a></p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/entity-201\">Entity 201 - \"Blue-Ringed Deerlings\"</a>\" by centurys lute, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

Taken shortly before its termination.</p><br><p>Bident is the name given to a neutralized entity that was discovered in <a href=\"/level-466\">Level 466</a> when it was found attacking the U.E.C. base in the level. During this event, the entity was neutralized by HDF members E. Triggs and K. Breivik with minimal damage and no casualties. No other instances of the entity have been reported before or since the incident, and its exact origin is unknown at this time.</p><br><p>The entity takes the appearance of a large, two-headed humanoid with a height of 2.23 meters (7.32 feet). It has dark red skin and is completely hairless with no sexual characteristics, ungues, nipples, or facial features, with the exception of a mouth found on its right head. The mouth in question shares many similarities with those found in primates, particularly in the structure of the teeth. Several fingers on the entity's hands have fused together, leaving it with two fingers and one thumb on each hand. The entity's physique is extremely muscular and combined with its large size, this made it a dangerous threat when it was alive. Additionally, the entity was found with a two-pronged spear that had iron tips and a wooden handle. Analysis of the spear revealed no irregular properties.</p><br><p>The entity's cadaver was dissected, and it was found to have a physiology very similar to that of a human pair of conjoined twins, with two sets of most major organs. In addition, it was found to have an additional organ above its left stomach that seemed to have produced a fluid with similar effects to <a href=\"/object-11\">Object 11</a>. This fluid seemed to have been pumped directly into the entity's left brain. What this accomplished for the entity is unknown, but <a href=\"/level-799\">research is ongoing</a>.</p><br><p>The entity's cadaver is currently being stored in a morgue on Level 466.</p><br><p><span class=\"titlebox\">Translated Audio Log</span><br/>\n<strong>Document Description:</strong><br/>\nThe following audio log contains a translation of the last words spoken by the entity as it bled out, as recorded by a nearby security camera.

    "description": "<p><strong>Entity 204</strong>, known as <strong>tagalongs</strong>, are humanoid entities that exhibit a parasitic relationship with <a href=\"/entity-1\">humans</a>. They resemble humans closely when viewed from afar or in peripheral vision, though unnatural and disturbing features reveal themselves upon further inspection.</p><br><p><strong>Tagalongs</strong> are found near human bases and communities, though they can survive independently without sustenance for prolonged periods<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup>. Though the entities do not need food or drink to survive, they will consume any that is given to them in an apparent bid to mimic human behaviour. This is usually quite dicomforting to watch, due to the <strong>tagalongs'</strong> strange facial structure and unnatural movements. It should also be noted that <strong>tagalongs</strong> do not sleep.</p><br><p>Humans who attempt to interact with a <strong>tagalong</strong> will begin to exhibit selective memory loss and confusion, and will begin to believe that the <strong>tagalong</strong> in question is another human being. After this happens, the human is considered <em>infected</em> and is not to be interacted with further<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup>.</p><br><p>A <strong>tagalong</strong> merging with a wanderer.</p><br><p><strong>Tagalongs</strong> propagate through a process of <em>infection</em>, wherein the human host is lulled into a sense of security and familiarity and then merged with. The host will begin to recognise the <strong>tagalong</strong> as a friend or family member, or construct new memories of such people to line up with the <strong>tagalong</strong>'s appearance.</p><br><p>During this time, the parasitic <strong>tagalong</strong> will stay extremely close to its host, maintaining constant physical contact if possible \u2014 usually by standing directly next to them and having their heads, hands, or sides touch. During this initial stage of propagation, the <strong>tagalong</strong>'s mimicking of human behaviour ceases and the entity becomes dormant, though the host will continue to engage in one-sided conversations with the entity. When the host sleeps, the <strong>tagalong</strong> will stand guard and protect them from threats.</p><br><p>Over time, individuals experience prominent headaches, hearing and sight loss, and even full loss of awareness of their situation \u2014 many end up believing that they are located within <a href=\"/the-frontrooms\">the Frontrooms</a>.</p><br><p>After about a week's time, the host becomes unable to walk and stops responding to stimuli. That being said, removal of the <strong>tagalong</strong> from the host will still provoke a reaction through unknown means.

    "description": "<p><strong>Will o' Waves</strong> are small, bioluminescent shrimp-like creatures that roam the dimly lit, flooded levels of the Backrooms. These entities, despite their grotesque appearance, are completely docile in nature and are even said to be a good omen for travelers. Their lights often lead people to safe places and resources, avoiding any dangers that may be lurking nearby.</p><br><p>Little is known about the nature of <strong>Will o' Waves</strong>, but they are typically located in dark, underwater environments, regardless of the water's quality or salinity. <strong>Will o' Waves</strong> travel in shoals of up to roughly 50-300 individuals, moving in single file down watery channels usually following the current. They strongly dislike artificial light and will vanish immediately when shined on.</p><br><p><strong>Will o' Waves</strong> are completely docile and would usually ignore any passerby in their location. If approached slowly and given at least several drops of fresh blood, <strong>Will o' Waves</strong> emit a gentle harmonious humming tune and perform synchronized flashes from the back to front of the shoal. Following the shoal will often lead travelers to areas of low entity count, high amounts of resources and supplies, or even exits and passageways that are otherwise hard to find. It is currently unknown if this aid is intentional.</p><br><p><strong>Will o' Waves</strong> are semi-crustacean entities roughly 13-15 centimeters in length with similar anatomy to a shrimp. Its exoskeleton is completely translucent, though none of its internal organs are visible, and whether said organs exist is currently unknown. <strong>Will o' Waves</strong> possess a set of long, sharp teeth and a flexible jaw, however their hunting behavior has never been observed. The entity's most prominent feature are the bioluminescent dorsal spines across its back, which emit a bright blue light that it can flash independently. Two red bioluminescent patches are also located right behind its eyes, which seem to help it navigate in the water.</p><br><p><strong>Will o' Waves</strong> biological findings are not yet well studied. This is due to the entity's bizarre capabilities. <strong>Will o' Waves</strong> are partly intangible, while clearly physically present, slipping past solid objects as water would. When startled, they simply dissolve into the water, leaving behind a cloud of glowing golden particles that stick onto whatever they come into contact with. These particles are hard to remove and highlight the location of the covered individuals to all nearby entities. This defensive strategy makes <strong>Will o' Waves</strong> completely immune to capture.</p><br><p>Written by <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/the-dragon-king\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(4285304); return false;\"><img alt=\"The Dragon King\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=4285304&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334082\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=4285304)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/the-dragon-king\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(4285304); return false;\">The Dragon King</a></span><br/>\nCo-author <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/iamalemon\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7491662); return false;\"><img alt=\"Iamalemon\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7491662&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334082\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7491662)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/iamalemon\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7491662); return false;\">Iamalemon</a></span></p><br><p>\u00ab <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/entity-206\">Entity 206</a> | Entity 207 | <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/entity-208\">Entity 208</a> \u00bb</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/entity-207\">Entity 207</a>\" by The Dragon King, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

    "description": "<p>Entity 212, nicknamed \"WOOOM\", are passive / semi hazardous entities that resemble a fat, rainbow axolotl plush in fresh condition. They are rare and highly elusive, with only 7 confirmed sightings across Level 18, Level 25, and Level 998. It is theorized that WOOOMs could inhabit levels that are not yet completely explored.</p><br><p>WOOOMs have limited mobility, so they use a shockwave process for faster traveling. The following process consists of this, The entity compresses its body similarly to a person squeezing an accordion. This action then compresses mass around itself in a 1-meter radius, making objects or air packed tightly together. Once it completes the process, it will then release the compressed matter, causing a shockwave of about 3 meters in radius, creating a sound which gives it its nickname. This will then makes a WOOOM propel itself for faster traveling. Although the shockwave can't harm you, exposure to it can cause symptoms ranging from headache, sore muscles, nausea, auditory and visual hallucinations. These symptoms can last from 30 seconds to 10 minutes. Due to their more peaceful nature, they tend to do fewer shockwaves near humans. It's theorized that WOOOMs use this passive behavior to attract humans into carrying them as a method of transportation due to their slow shockwave buildup or seeking companionship, but that Is not 100% confirmed. As of now, there have been no reports of intentional malicious actions performed by these entities.</p><br><p>WOOOMs have many strange properties, for example, they are not affected by gravity, they are extremely light, and they are indestructible as they're capable of surviving <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-104\">Entity 104's</a> cropping. WOOOMs are believed to be sentient, while having great vision, However, they are believed to be mildly deaf. WOOOMs aren't also believed to be organic as they have not been reported to have the need to eat or drink. Despite their plush like body, they can move their limbs to swim short distances.</p><br><p>The following logs are each of WOOOM's first discoveries in Level 18, Level 25, and Level 998.</p><br><p><strong>&lt;Begin Log Level 18 report&gt;</strong></p><br><p><strong>Unknown Wanderer:</strong> Reporter</p><br><p><strong>M.E.G.:</strong> Operator</p><br><p><strong>M.E.G.:</strong> Hello, and how I can assist you.</p><br><p><strong>Unknown Wanderer:</strong> I found a floating plushie in Level 18.</p><br><p><strong>M.E.G.:</strong> Can you elaborate on that please?.</p><br><p><strong>Unknown Wanderer:</strong> It's a floating plushie that looks like a rainbow colored axolotl.</p><br><p><strong>M.E.G.:</strong> Um\u2026 ok so, what is it doing?</p><br><p><strong>Unknown Wanderer:</strong> It's just floating on top of some couch.</p><br><p><strong>M.E.G.:</strong> Okay, stay right where you are, and officers are on their way.</p><br><p><strong>Unknown Wanderer:</strong> What is this thing anyway?</p><br><p><strong>M.E.G.:</strong> Don't know.</p><br><p><strong>Unknown Wanderer:</strong> Um it's squeezing itself slowly.</p><br><p><strong>M.E.G.:</strong> Is it looking at you?</p><br><p><strong>Unknown Wanderer:</strong> No, but should I step back?</p><br><p><strong>M.E.G.:</strong> It's highly recommended you do.</p><br><p><strong>M.E.G.:</strong> Hello?</p><br><p><strong>Unknown Wanderer:</strong> \u2026</p><br><p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p><br><p><strong>&lt;Begin Log Level 25 note&gt;</strong></p><br><p>The note is written by a wanderer that tells a description of an Entity 212 encounter in Level 25.</p><br><p>I have been probably far enough from every thing trying to kill me. I found a safe level clear from anything and made a home there until something finds me. So I played an arcade game to pass time and like the previous guy surviving, it is a dusty paradise with endless entertainment. I can\u2019t keep track of the time, but it's been awhile, and I still seem to be alone. Until I looked behind for once and saw this axolotl plush spectating me while floating. Out of panic, I punched it and darted off till I looked back, expecting it to chase after me, but it just stared at me with no emotion. It then wiggled its little legs in the air like it was swimming to the arcade machine and continued staring at it. I left my supplies there, so I took the risk to sneak it back since that thing was distracted. I got a grip of my stuff and took off before that plush returns its attention to me. The blank stare looked like the thing was confused or curious, but I still darted away for the best. I thought to myself that this thing was harmless and the only thing that is not out there to kill me, but I moved on to surviving on this Level, hopefully alone from anything.</p><br><p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p><br><p><strong>&lt;Begin Log WOOOM weapon note&gt;</strong></p><br><p>Okay, I got to this grey area in this level and the luckiest of all is that I found a WOOOM nearby. I stayed my distance in case of it building up a shockwave and observed this rare discovery. It felt like I was in a rare animal documentary as the host interacts with the animal. It hadn't noticed me yet, so I took this opportunity to make my presence known, so I could go near it. Before I could get close to it, I noticed a pack of hounds were charging at me from a distance, and the WOOOM was building up a shockwave. I had nothing on me but food, so I panicked until I got the idea of using the WOOOM to stun them. They were getting closer, so I quickly tried this idea and threw the WOOOM at the hound pack. The shockwave was strong enough to paralyze the hounds, making them unable to move. So I decided to snatch the WOOOM out of panic and carried it while turning back away from the gray point. Finally, I got to the entrance after a long time and kept the WOOOM. It was able to save my life from getting mauled by hounnds, and I wanted it to keep me safe. after awhile in level 81, l finally gave it a name and called it Gooby.<br/>\n<strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p><br><p>[DIS IS LE WOOOM]<br/>\nmr bloop (the author)<br/>\nlink for image <a href=\"http://backrooms-sandbox-2.wdfiles.com/local--files/bloop-s-enity-212/WOOOM.jpg\">http://backrooms-sandbox-2.wdfiles.com/local--files/bloop-s-enity-212/WOOOM.jpg</a><br/>\nits made by me</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/entity-212\">Entity 212 - \"WOOOM\"</a>\" by mrbloop, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

    "description": "<p>Formally known as the Subjects of the First Prince and officially designated as Entity 216, the Petrified Subjects are a complex hive mind humanoid population transfigured into stone statues and other constructs through an anomalous method by an enigmatic figure known as the \"First Prince\". Entity 216 instances are located within levels predominantly human-populated, such as <a href=\"/level-1\">Level 1</a>, <a href=\"/level-10\">Level 10</a>, <a href=\"/level-11\">Level 11</a>, and more, although other instances have also been seen in isolated locations and regions.</p><br><p>The current estimated population of Entity 216 instances ranges around the billions and likely more based on several testimonies with the population of Entity 216; note that this does not account for the total amount of all Petrified vessels, as most Entity 216 instances are shared or merged in the same vessel or statue. Due to Entity 216's supernatural hive mind capabilities, their entire population possesses high human-level intelligence and is primarily well-informed and experienced in several topics, such as science, philosophy, literature, mathematics, and more.</p><br><p>Entity 216 vessels appear to be humanoid by default, with moderate alterations and exaggerations in their biology and physical appearance. An exhibit of photographs taken by several wanderers, with the expressed consent of the following the Petrified people, are shown below.</p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p><br><p>Photograph of Entity 216. Vessel of the Petrified Viceroy and other Petrified Elders. <em>\"Sometimes we reach out to the sky in hopes to find our Prince.\"</em></p><br><p>Photograph of Entity 216. A council of Petrified Elders.</p><br><p>Photograph of Entity 216. The brothers Keral, Jezghe, and Lauol.</p><br><p>Photograph of Entity 216. The \"Headless Idiots\" in <a href=\"/level-11\">Level 11</a>.</p><br><p>Photograph of Entity 216. A Petrified Citizen named Rixeth.</p><br><p>Photograph of Entity 216.

A council of Petrified Elders in <a href=\"/level-1\">Level 1</a>.</p><br><p>Entity 216's population has been existing within the Backrooms for approximately 125,000,000 years at least;<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> this suggests that Entity 216 has been existing for no less than 3 billion years within their realm. This extensive timespan propagated Entity 216 into a multi-billion populated and modernized civilization in a realm in their hive mind.</p><br><p>The entire population religiously worships and serves a godlike enigma known as the \"First Prince\", the \"Lord the Prince the First\", or simply the \"Prince\". Further details such as its name and full capabilities are unknown to the rest of the human population and are likely to be never revealed. Entity 216's race originated in an outside realm like the Frontrooms; this realm is the dominion of the First Prince and the original home of the Petrified Subjects. Substantial interviews with Entity 216 instances suggest that the realm was likely around a medieval and peaceful era.</p><br><p>Despite the total amount of their population, their overall lifestyles are peaceful, normal, and unitized, with zero to no conflict in their midst. Their communities are, as far as we know and have documented, organized and tranquil due to their hive mind and constantly optimistic nature. Their cities are suggested to be extremely modernized and connected, possessing no weaponry or military organizations due to their realm being devoid of any conflict, hostile entities, and/or rival factions to compete against. Among themselves, they are extremely intertwined and rooted, making them one of the most efficient species that has ever been discovered within the Backrooms yet.</p><br><p>The population of Entity 216 exhibits very optimistic and direct personalities; it is observed that the younger the generation is, the more Petrified Citizens are casual and direct with the person they are conversing with, while the Petrified people of the older generations come across to be more relaxed, composed, optimistic, and subtle with their approach. This is said to be a natural development of a civilization and its development, as this behavior is also seen in humans but is interesting for a hive mind population.</p><br><p>Entity 216 instances are also primarily friendly with humans, conversing with them on a daily basis and creating friendships with almost every wanderer they meet. It seems that their population is fond of humanity and their customs, sometimes relating to the stories wanderers tell them. In a certain way, they have found a connection with a species not of their own and are a breath of fresh air after being alone in an isolated mind world. It is suggested that humanity care and bond with these entities as they are genuine and hospitable to humankind.</p><br><p>Living within different time perspectives is observed to be of no confusion within the Petrifieds' lives; when asked specifically about this dilemma, they would always state that they do not pay any attention to the passing time and would always live a casual, flowing life due to their immortality. This seems that time to the Entity 216 population is regarded as useless, and they would not notice the constant fluctuation amidst states of time perception between the Backrooms and the hive mind realm, yet despite these circumstances, they always appear to be lively and optimistic despite their ability of baseline immortality.</p><br><p>All entity instances' anatomy and biology within their vessels do not contain any alien or foreign matter and are clearly composed of a mixture of basalt, diorite, concrete, hematite, and other common rocks and materials. The anomalous transfiguration or transition from flesh matter into the complete stone matter that is the vessels of Entity 216 is still unknown despite extensive study. No further research has been enacted on this matter, as it is required to chip materials from the Entity 216 vessels in order to conduct an analysis of material composition.</p><br><p>Entity 216 instances sense externally from their vessels using highly sensitive echolocation that naturally developed due to their statued state; this was proven when a council of Petrified Elders stated that they could only see and feel through sounds and vibrations. This ability does not seem to be dependent on the statue's or construct's head as seen by the group of headless Petrified Citizens in Level 11.</p><br><p>The population of Entity 216 is theorized to have been technically discovered in the Backrooms by the earliest humans approximately 300,000 years ago, but its official record of date was in mid-2012 after being located in Level 1 by the first human group in the Backrooms known as the M.E.G. A log of the first interactions with Entity 216 instances has never been recorded due to the lack of resources at the time.</p><br><p><span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/schulzenreich\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7844614); return false;\"><img alt=\"Schulzenreich\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7844614&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1731589842\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7844614)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/schulzenreich\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7844614); return false;\">Schulzenreich</a></span></p><br><p><span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/sky3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7870251); return false;\"><img alt=\"Sky3\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7870251&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1731589842\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7870251)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/sky3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7870251); return false;\">Sky3</a></span></p><br><p><span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/whoyoucallinapinhead\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6058562); return false;\"><img alt=\"WhoYouCallinAPinHead\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=6058562&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1731589842\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=6058562)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/whoyoucallinapinhead\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6058562); return false;\">WhoYouCallinAPinHead</a></span> for critiquing Entity 216.<br/>\n<span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/sky3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7870251); return false;\"><img alt=\"Sky3\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7870251&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1731589842\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7870251)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/sky3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7870251); return false;\">Sky3</a></span> for critiquing Entity 216 and going through the trouble of putting several commas and semicolons to fix my article.</p><br><p><strong>Petrified 1</strong> - <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/montrealprotest/27347214788/\">\"Art on the grounds of a mental asylum 1\"</a> by <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/montrealprotest/\">photographymontreal</a> released under CC0 - Public Domain.<br/>\n<strong>Petrified 2</strong> - <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/montrealprotest/41182361472/\">\"Art on the grounds of a mental asylum 2\"</a> by <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/montrealprotest/\">photographymontreal</a> released under CC0 - Public Domain.<br/>\n<strong>Petrified 3</strong> - <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/montrealprotest/27362056978/\">\"Art on the grounds of a mental asylum 3\"</a> by <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/montrealprotest/\">photographymontreal</a> released under CC0 - Public Domain.<br/>\n<strong>Petrified 4</strong> - <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/montrealprotest/34119215954/\">\"Headless Idiots\"</a> by <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/montrealprotest/\">photographymontreal</a> released under CC0 - Public Domain.<br/>\n<strong>Petrified 5</strong> - <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/montrealprotest/34829442594/\">\"Grief\"</a> by <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/montrealprotest/\">photographymontreal</a> released under CC0 - Public Domain.<br/>\n<strong>Petrified 6</strong> - <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/montrealprotest/21267425461/\">\"Resignation\"</a> by <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/montrealprotest/\">photographymontreal</a> released under CC0 - Public Domain.<br/>\n<strong>Petrified 7</strong> - <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/montrealprotest/19908484746/\">\"Alien Sculptures 3\"</a> by <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/montrealprotest/\">photographymontreal</a> released under CC0 - Public Domain.</p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/entity-215\">Entity 215</a> | Entity 216 | <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/entity-217\">Entity 217</a> \u00bb</p><br>",

    "description": "<p>Instances of Entity 222, otherwise known as Soulsuckers, are bipedal androids, with a manufactured height of 7 ft. Most units are largely in a state of disrepair, with some only carrying superficial injuries, to some sustaining limb loss. These entities have an exposed mechanical system, covered in part by translucent plastic mimicking the human form. Some Soulsuckers are lit by internal LEDs, and can be seen from far away in the dark. Due to dilapidation, however, this is not a guarantee.</p><br><p>Soulsuckers operate solely on some form of AI. No components have ever been recovered in working order, so exact operational parameters are unavailable, but through observation, we know they operate in a 4 stage pattern.</p><br><p>During Standby, Soulsuckers move ambivalently throughout terrain, pivoting the head to keep a full peripheral vision. Cone of vision tests have concluded they can see up to 30 meters ahead in a 180 degree field of vision, without moving their head. Swiveling brings this up to 270 degrees. This vision is not inhibited by light levels, and is likely based on infrared sensors. Occasionally they will move in packs, if available. It is believed that at one point they may have always operated this way, but due to lower numbers, often operate in a solitary fashion. Upon sensing a living human being who has not undergone 'SEE' (a soul extraction event), Soulsuckers move into phase 1.</p><br><p>Phase 1 lasts approximately one and a half minutes. During this time, Soulsuckers emit a siren, not unlike a wail, from their mouths. This wail attracts other Soulsuckers in the area, even if they are not a part of the original pack. While doing so, they will attempt to capture a target, that being the aforementioned living human who has not undergone 'SEE'. During this state, Soulsuckers have been observed moving at speeds up to and exceeding 30 miles per hour. Due to poor traction of terrain or dilapidation, Soulsuckers oftentimes do not capture a target. When this happens, Phase 2 begins.</p><br><p>Phase 2, like Phase 1, lasts approximately one and a half minutes. In this phase, an individual entity ceases to wail, and slows to the original pace. Soulsuckers will investigate hiding spots or other exits in a roughly 500 sq foot area, or a radius of about 50 yards. During this time, it's advised that you evacuate the area, as the entities are diligent hunters. After exhausting all avenues of egress, a Soulsucker will move to Phase 3. If, through canvasing the area, the target or a new one is found, the entity moves back to Phase 1.</p><br><p>Standby+ is an indefinite phase characterized by the return of activities from Standby, with added activities. It is unknown whether Standby+ is truly distinct from Standby, but Soulsuckers have been observed taking different routes after being disturbed, inspecting otherwise harmless evidences of human activity, and an increased response to sound after initiating a phase change compared to beforehand. The duration of Standby+ is equally unknown. During this time, if possible, Soulsuckers will also attempt to repair any damages incurred during a search. If any of the new protocols lead to detection of a human, the androids move back into Phase 1.</p><br><p>A 'SEE' event occurs upon capture of the target sought during the Alarm phase. The servos within the hands of an instance of Entity 222 are strong enough to hold a fully grown man, and they will re-orient the victim until they are facing one another. Strong cables are drawn out of the nostrils, and these robotic tendrils force open the targets eyelids, preventing them from closing. At this time, an unknown pattern and/or spectrum of light is emitted from the pupils of the entity. Upon interacting with the victim, this light appears to remove all traces of personality, memory, or individuality<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup>.</p><br><p>'SEE' events are not local; memories about the user in question are edited. Actions are persistent, but the identity and intention of the victim are erased from collective memory. Documentation, like video recordings, remain unaffected, but text referencing these users or describing them is found missing, regardless of the state it's rendered in. Victims of 'SEE' events often wander the Level they encountered an instance of Entity 222 on, with no intent behind their actions, until recovered by another person. Highly regarded members of M.E.G. posts leave, only to be forgotten abruptly and unanimously, until an empty shell resembling them is found days, weeks, or months later.</p><br><p>Only pre-'SEE' image of Luis available.</p><br><p>Archivist Luis Flores is one of several recovered post-'SEE' individuals available for study. Due to prior involvement with the M.E.G., we are aware of several things concerning him, including his likeness (shown right), his name, and certain confidential medical details. However, staff specifically listed as working alongside him have no memory of his or any similar staff member's involvement in any projects, pre-'SEE' event. The last pre-'SEE' record of his activities details his active study of Entity 222 and the effects they have on humans, and notes that he was dispatched to Level 522 with several other members of staff. None of them could be recalled by associated staff members, nor by Luis himself, who suffered rapid onset retrograde amnesia and an unknown type of identity disorder. He's easily characterized by an apathetic personality with little to willpower. This contrasts with minor details within his and others reports, which insinuate a previous desire for deduction and forensic skills to back that desire up. Duration of this effect is unknown, likely indefinite.</p><br><p>Soulsuckers have several unique design quirks that should be discussed/can be exploited. Of note is the necessitation of the eye units to perform a 'SEE' event. In the case that even one of the eyes is damaged, no detrimental effect has been gleaned from a Soulsucker attempting a 'SEE' event. However, upon failure, the unit will attempt to physically harm any humans in the area, rather than engage them traditionally. This, combined with or interchanged with disabling the bipedal walking system, is the best way to evade this entity.</p><br><p>Of note are the several units observed with partial exoskeletal features. Some instances have been spotted with black, plate-like structures covering vital components. One instance (no picture found) even sported a black, skull-like mask, with eye and nose holes for continued optimal operation. Significance of these features is unknown. Competing theories include the concept that these units are superior, all units once had these and have now lost them, and more.</p><br><p>Hello there. Welcome to ARCHIVE OS.

    "description": "<p>Entity 227 is a group of sentient aircraft fighters composed of miniature model plane kits. The planes in the squadron can vary, but from captured specimens, most appear to be P-51D Mustangs from the American Army Air Force during WWII. All recorded specimens of Entity 227 are measured as 12\" x 14\" x 4\".<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup></p><br><p>Instances of Entity 227 fly in groups of thirty and always in a Vic formation, with extra fighters being placed at the back of the formation to create another Vic. The squadron usually has three V's, though sometimes a few fighters are missing from a previous battle. In any appearance of the squadron, at least three or more planes are damaged from various types of attacks, usually gunfire from other \"planes.\" Other model planes have been discovered, such as Bf 109s, B-25s, and a singular He-111. While very rarely spotted, it is assumed that these planes of differing factions engage in aerial combat with one another.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup></p><br><p>When spotting a human target, Entity 227 will immediately begin firing their weapons at them. These weapons can include, but are not limited to: six wing cannons, bombs, rockets, and others. These weapons, though smaller in scale from their Frontrooms-counterparts, can easily pierce through tissue and cause the same damage as a full-sized plane.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')\">3</a></sup></p><br><p>Instances are manned by no visible crew. When attacked, no pilots are seen ejecting. When disassembling an Entity 277 instance, its fuel, ammo, hydraulics, and various other components mirror that of a P-51D Mustang's.</p><br><p>The materials these components are comprised of have been observed to be different than their counter-parts. Hydraulic systems are composed of bones and <a href=\"/object-48\">Liquid Pain</a> despite its lack of traits needed to activate an instance's flaps or landing gear. Entity 227 instances are seen firing a large amount of bullets and deploying ordinance, though when theoretically running out if ammo or ordinance, it is restocked by unknown means. Due to the large variation of ammo types, information about documented rounds has been provided below.</p><br><p>The reasoning for why this small-caliber ammunition causes such high-impact damage is still unknown. Currently, the leading theory is that, regardless of their contents, the bullets, bombs, and rockets all have the same density or explosive mass that would be seen in full-size ordinance. How this occurs is unknown, especially with the ammunition's payload.</p><br><p>A wanderer named Tommy Price first brought instances of Entity 227 to the M.E.G.'s attention on <a href=\"/level-11\">Level 11</a>. The man had a lengthy report on how he had found a group of Entity 227, and it has been documented below.</p><br><p>I had found these little model planes sittin down in <a href=\"/level-277\">Level... 277,</a> I believe it was. They were all lined up on a long table 'n looked like they were being repaired 'n restocked. I approached them, because I thought that they were just some models that a hobbyist was making. Their engines started igniting and propellers spinning, and pretty quickly I realized that these little planes were not made by some hobbyist, haha! If they were, that sum-bitch must know what he's doin!</p><br><p>At the time I had my uh\u2026 my cap on, and as I got closer they didn't move like I thought they would. Out of nowhere they formed into three Vic's on their little makeshift runway. They looked as if they were aboutta take off, but they just sat there, engines whirrin.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-4\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')\">4</a></sup></p><br><p>As I got close the little P-51's let me pick 'em up. They were really fuckin heavy for a small model plane, but this whole place is run to shit.</p><br><p>I felt a little bit of comfort around 'em. Might be cause I'm a veteran myself, because they're somethin I recognize, or some other subconscious trait. Whatever it was, I stuck around in that place for a pretty long while. Those planes flew around me and shot down those damn monsters that tried to charge me. Little things caused just as much damage as a full sized 12 millimeter cannon, so I'm glad those little shits didn't turn their guns on me, hahaha!</p><br><p>Decided to bring one or two with me to Level 11 and see if I could find one of y'alls outposts.

    "description": "<p>Entity 230, colloquially named <strong>Baggers</strong>, are known to frequent most sectors of <a href=\"/level-230\">Level 230</a>. Similar in appearance to the merchants of the <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/free-traders-of-the-backrooms\">Free Traders of the Backrooms</a>, they often impersonate them. Typically they either \"wear\" hoodies or cloaks (it is not known if these apparent pieces of apparel are part of their anatomy).</p><br><p>While unaccompanied by other entities, <strong>Baggers</strong> are generally not aggressive. Their main motive seems to be greed and trickery as they are willing to trade for anything they perceive is valuable to the wanderer is involved. They will attempt, often with much success, to impersonate traders of the <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/free-traders-of-the-backrooms\">Free Traders of the Backrooms</a>. They will then try to sell you one of their many \"quality\" wares. Most times, such a sale will often lead to either a product (often false or defective. For example, they have been known to \"mix up\" <a href=\"/object-48\">liquid pain</a> for <a href=\"/object-1\">almond water</a>) or, in more rare and dangerous cases, an ambush by other hostile entities. If they say they have more merchandise at another location, <strong>do not</strong> follow it. It will almost definitely be a trap. They can often be seen carrying an oversized bag over their right shoulder and walk with a shuffling gait. If you do wish to make a purchase from these entities, ask to examine said product thoroughly before you act; and be sure to ask many questions. They may seem agitated by your inquiries, but they will not attack, flee, or react in any other way.</p><br><p><strong>Baggers</strong> can enter many states, the first, being Psychological State (PSYS) 1, is when they feel they are being observed. They will act much like a used car salesman with a flamboyant gait and are prone to enthused haggling. However, in PSYS 2 when the wanderer appears to be confused, they will act more like their natural instinctive self; walking with a strange gait, talking in hushed tones, and glancing furtively around themselves. In this deposition, they will often push more illegitimate sales. The final and most predatorial state, PSYS 3, or \"Sales Shark\" phase, they will typically conduct in deserted areas hunting lone wanderers and making their most sketchy deals. In this phase, their attempts to sell you an item are particularly aggressive and deceiving. It is best to avoid them at this stage.</p><br><p>While the <strong>Baggers'</strong> physiology is largely unknown, in part due to their recent discovery, some things may be gathered or conjectured. Firstly, hoodies or cloaks seem to be included with every known occurrence of said entity. It is not known if this is part of its anatomy or simply an article of clothing. The face, if in fact it exists, is hidden by its hoodie. They are anthropomorphic, possessing 4 limbs and a head. Certain entity scientists assigned to this being hypothesize that <strong>Baggers</strong> have evolved to mimic the likeness of traders in order to secure wanderers. What they do to them once they are alone is unknown. These scientists believe that they, and perhaps the other entities involved in the ambush, feed on the persons. This is unproven because no wanderer has been documented to have survived.</p><br><p>Sightings of Baggers had begun roughly 2 years after the establishment of bases on <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-230\">Level 230</a>. <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-m-e-g\">M.E.G.</a> operatives were drawn to this instance due to various complaints of strange and suspicious traders. Warnings have been posted around secured areas since the first recorded occurrence.</p><br><p>As stated in the previous section (Discovery), the M.E.G. and the Free State of Portage (F.S.P.) <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-230\">(See F.S.P. entry in Level 230 page.)</a> strongly discourage interactions between wanderers and Baggers, due to the fact that it is difficult to discern between these entities and the members of the Free Traders of the Backrooms <a href=\"http://backrooms-sandbox-2.wikidot.com/ftb\">(F.T.B.)</a>. This has served to decrease business with the <a href=\"http://backrooms-sandbox-2.wikidot.com/ftb\">F.T.B.</a></p><br><p>In the Level 230 Newscast, a spokesman for the F.T.B. issued a statement saying that <strong>Baggers</strong> are not a part of the <a href=\"http://backrooms-sandbox-2.wikidot.com/ftb\">F.T.B.</a> They have advised wanderers to ask an <a href=\"http://backrooms-sandbox-2.wikidot.com/ftb\">F.T.B.</a> trader to remove their hoods, and all merchants have been ordered to comply with such requests. <strong>Baggers</strong> are known to not remove their hoods and all attempts to forcibly remove their hoods have proven fruitless given their evasive nature.</p><br><p>Discoverer Unknown.

    "description": "<p><strong>Entity 231</strong>, commonly known as <strong>Porters</strong>, are known to frequent the docks of <a href=\"/level-230\">Level 230</a>. They are often observed wearing a fur-lined coat with a gas mask. They are more individually differentiated than most hostile entities, and a specific Porter can even be personally identified by its unique coat and mask. To date, 50 distinct Porters have been identified, though there are likely many more that have yet to be observed.</p><br><p>When they are away from their ships, Porters typically move alone. This should not embolden wanderers in approaching them, as a single Porter has enough brute strength to easily overwhelm and kill as many as 5 well-armed individuals at once.</p><br><p>Porters dwell in the docks of <a href=\"/level-230\">Level 230</a>, embarking on and disembarking from a number of ships. It has been hypothesized that they assist other \"sailor-type\" entities on ships with the transport of cargo. They can frequently be observed off-loading numerous boxes and containers from these ships, and transporting them to unknown locations. The contents of these containers are unknown.</p><br><p>Porters are not passive entities, showing significant intelligence and sharp situational awareness. Upon detection of any wanderer in the vicinity, they will relentlessly pursue and attack without provocation, and are capable of inflicting great harm upon any person unfortunate to cross their path. The hooks porters carry in their hands, combined with their bestial strength, prove to be deadly for most victims caught in their sights. Fortunately for wanderers, Porters have never been sighted outside the docks.</p><br><p>Porters are bipedal, with two arms and human-like proportions. Standing at an average height of 6 feet, their well-built frames are akin to that of muscular football players. They wear dark blue fur-lined coats with a distinct smell of oil and sawdust, and dark green gas masks that obscure their faces. Their legs are clad in tan cargo pants, often stained with a black, tar-ish substance, and their steel-toed boots show signs of wear. Their stride betrays their menacing strength, a limber gait full of aggressive intent.</p><br><p>Attempts to discover more about the anatomy of porters have been mostly unsuccessful, as the M.E.G. has not yet managed to retrieve any dead porter specimens for study. While it has been confirmed that they have human faces, little more is known about the creatures hiding underneath the coats and masks. Porters have proven too aggressive to incapacitate, and any M.E.G. operative who has gotten close enough to unmask one has not survived to describe its face in detail.</p><br><p>After the discovery of <a href=\"/entity-230\">Entity 230</a> (i.e Baggers), the formal documentation of Entity 231 soon followed.

    "description": "<p>A rare picture of a Drowner out of water. The location and photographer are unknown.</p><br><p>Entity 232, or <strong>Drowners</strong>, often lurk in watery areas such as those found in <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-230\">Level 230</a>, <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-34\">Level 34</a>, and <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-43\">Level 43</a>. The most distinctive feature of a Drowner is their weathered yellow raincoat, always with the hood pulled over their head. They have never been seen without this coat. Additionally, they wear black rubber boots and work pants. All of these have different levels of wear and tear, some Drowners may have a blood (or what looks like blood) stained coat, some have ripped pants, and some have even been seen missing a boot.</p><br><p>Where there's water or other liquids, Drowners may be found lurking just beneath the surface waiting for unsuspecting passersby to become their next victim. When one gets close to a lurking Drowner, it will attempt to grab any exposed limb or submerged body part. They do this to inflict their anomalous effect on wanderers. When a Drowner successfully restrains a wanderer while making skin-to-skin contact, in a few seconds the wanderer's lungs will begin to fill with water, killing them from asphyxiation. If a Drowner is unable to execute this plan, they will try to give chase. Drowners move in a lumbering manner that is slower than the average human running speed, however, their slow nature should not be underestimated as usually they are encountered in water which they are able to anomalously move through unimpeded. As such, it is likely that in water they could very well catch wanderers due to their impaired movement. Unless provoked, Drowners will lie beneath the water for a seemingly indefinite amount of time. As a result, Drowners are rarely seen out of water.</p><br><p>Drowners are surprisingly persistent; even after their potential victim has left the Drowner's body of water, they will still attempt to follow their prey. When on land, one can outmaneuver a Drowner with relative ease, but it is important to avoid closed areas where a Drowner could corner someone.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> If they catch a wanderer, they will pin them down and subject them to their anomalous effect. Should a wanderer be cornered by a Drowner, one may have to fight. If a fight is the only way, the <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-m-e-g\">M.E.G.</a> recommends the use of ranged weaponry due to the Drowner's anomalous effect and their well above average strength. They are resilient, but significant damage can put them down.</p><br><p>If a Drowner kills a wanderer within a body of water, it drags the body away from any on-lookers and seems to disappear with no trace of the Drowner or the body.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup> This process is similar if a Drowner kills a wanderer out of water, though notably the Drowner finds the nearest body of water before disappearing.</p><br><p>On the rare occurrences that Drowners are seen outside a body of water, they have been observed to shamble around with little to no intention. They will attempt to give chase if a wanderer approaches them while in this state.</p><br><p>Drowners are bipedal, with two arms and human proportions, though they are notably lanky in build. Drowners have dark gray skin, a gaunt face with sunken eyes, and a mouth filled with rotted human-like teeth. Their facial features can vary; some have been noted to have patchy beards, scars covering their face, or even hair hanging over their face. They have been observed to be 6 to 6.5 ft. tall and seem to weigh between 100-120 pounds.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')\">3</a></sup></p><br><p>Due to M.E.G. operatives killing a Drowner within Level 230 and bringing its remains to Base Delta, an autopsy was able to shed light into a Drowner's inner workings. Firstly, the Drowner\u2019s anomalous properties persist through death. This was discovered when a <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-m-e-g\">M.E.G.</a> operative accidentally made skin-to-skin contact with the corpse and began to asphyxiate. Additionally, when the corpse was thrown into a pool of water it did not float or sink; it fell to the bottom of the pool as if the water was not there. The skin of the Drowner is leathery making it difficult to cut through, but M.E.G. researchers were eventually able to cut through revealing the innards of the Drowner. Within the body of the Drowner no organs were found, in fact, the only thing found within the Drowner is a brackish, water-like substance that fills every cavity where organs, bones, and muscles should be. This liquid is of unknown origin and its composition has yet to be fully observed. Though, given the discovery of Drowners, this liquid could very well be the same liquid that composes the large body of water found in Level 230.</p><br><p>Drowners were first discovered in Level 230 on 2/13/2021, when <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-m-e-g\">M.E.G.</a> operatives were observing The Docks within the level from afar via binoculars. As they were watching the docks, they saw several instances of <strong>Entity 232</strong> crawl from the brackish water adjacent to the docks. They report 10-12 were seen at once, which is strange given their usually solitary nature. After this sighting, Drowners were seen throughout level 230, and soon after reports of Drowners in other levels were documented as well. The method by which they appeared on other levels is unknown.</p><br><p>Written by<br/>\n<span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/derrick770\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(8372583); return false;\"><img alt=\"Derrick770\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=8372583&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334081\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=8372583)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/derrick770\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(8372583); return false;\">Derrick770</a></span></p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/entity-232\">Entity 232 - \"Drowners\"</a>\" by Derrick770, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

    "description": "<p>The Heart, prior to Andrew's death.</p><br><p><strong>Entity 246</strong>, formerly 29-year-old Andrew Donovan, is a corpse that has been floating around in a closed-off, heart-shaped pool (aptly named \"The Heart\") in <a href=\"/level-27\">the Bunker Springs</a> for approximately 4 months. It is not yet fully known how his corpse ended up in the pool, but leading theories suggest that he suffered a cardiac arrest in the water and subsequently drowned. Unfortunately, retrieval of his corpse is considered to be dangerous due to the Heart's scalding temperatures (80 to 90 degrees Celsius) atypical of the hot springs present. Despite the intense heat, his body has shown no signs of decomposition or damage.</p><br><p>Surprisingly, Andrew may still show signs of life, occasionally moving his limbs slightly or vocalizing pleas for help in an effort to garner attention. However, recording devices have not been able to capture Andrew's movements, and it is suspected that these occurrences are merely hallucinations. No matter what, the corpse's pleas are to be ignored. Andrew is dead<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup>.</p><br><p>Wanderers entranced by the corpse's cry for help tend to come too close to the water, leading to severe third-degree burns that require prompt medical attention. Those who enter the Heart receive even more serious injuries\u2014it is common for body parts to completely disintegrate within seconds of coming into contact with the water. Excessive bleeding stemming from this event then claims the individual's life within minutes. In rare cases, a wanderer might dive in the Heart, only to never resurface. It is important to remember that Andrew does not need rescuing. Andrew is dead<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup>.</p><br><p>The corpse seems to have exerted total control over the Heart, being able to glide seamlessly across the water by manipulating the flow of the current. In some cases, it may intentionally push itself toward the shore to attract the attention of concerned wanderers before floating away from them to lure people into the water. Touching the corpse has the same effect as touching the water and is therefore strongly discouraged. Many victims who have attempted to perform CPR on the entity were forced to have their hands amputated after suffering burns that paved the way for life-threatening bacterial infections. Andrew cannot be resuscitated. Andrew is dead<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')\">3</a></sup>.</p><br><p>The Heart desires bloodshed. After a string of tragic incidents involving dozens of accumulated deaths, it earned a secondary colloquial nickname\u2014\"Pool of Blood.\" Avoid the Heart at all costs.</p><br><p><strong>Preface:</strong> A team of 10 individuals, led by Justin and Katherine Zimals, was sent to retrieve the corpse of Andrew Donovan from the Heart.</p><br><p><strong>&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;</strong><br/>\n<em>[The group reaches the pool 13 minutes after leaving <a href=\"/level-11\">Level 11</a>. This part has been cut for brevity.]</em></p><br><p><strong>Katherine:</strong> There he is at the shore. If one person grabs each of his limbs, we should be able to haul his body to somewhere safer.</p><br><p><em>[Rapid footsteps. 4 individuals approach Andrew's corpse, ready to carry him on a stretcher. Justin tries to grab Andrew's arm but immediately screams and recoils in pain. Katherine begins to run over to him; she catches a glimpse of steam coming from his hand but ignores the ghastly sight. The rubber glove has completely melted, revealing a nasty burn on the skin underneath.]</em></p><br><p><strong>Justin [breathing heavily]:</strong> Wh-what the\u2026 hell?</p><br><p><em>[Everyone tries to back away from the corpse, except for Katherine, who continues running toward Justin, but Justin seems unable to move his right leg, which has started to burn like his hand.]</em></p><br><p><strong>Katherine [panting]:</strong> Justin\u2026 you need to get away!</p><br><p><strong>Justin [still breathing quickly]:</strong> I\u2026 can\u2019t!</p><br><p><em>[Katherine grabs Justin's arm tightly and desperately tries to pull him away, but she can't seem to do so.]</em></p><br><p><strong>Justin:</strong> Get\u2026 your hands\u2026 off of me!</p><br><p><strong>Katherine [slightly shocked]:</strong> No!</p><br><p><em>[Justin tries to violently shake his right leg but ends up tripping instead. He yelps in pain.]</em></p><br><p><em>[Katherine almost trips after this but regains her balance. She continues pulling, assuming that Justin's last comment was not directed at her. However, Justin's clothes have begun to catch fire, and she is forced to let go after she begins to feel unbearable heat in her hands. She quickly backs away from Justin and the corpse.]</em></p><br><p><em>[Several volunteers run to help Katherine while she swiftly retrieves her radio from her pocket, but Justin and the corpse are suddenly yanked into the pool by an unseen force. Several screams ring out as the two fall and splash several individuals with scalding water. Justin's muffled cries can be heard for a brief moment while everyone runs away from the water. The pool sizzles and bubbles for several seconds before finally calming down. Justin never resurfaces, but Andrew's corpse reappears in the center of the pool.]</em></p><br><p><strong>Katherine [panicking]:</strong> No\u2026 no\u2026 shit! We need doctors!</p><br><p><em>[Katherine's professional demeanor begins to break down. She continuously paces back and forth holding the radio with shaky hands as the injured individuals assess their burns. Several of them have passed out, while others are barely conscious but still in considerable amounts of pain. The camera pans to the pool for a brief moment before focusing on the team again. Andrew is gone.]</em></p><br><p><strong>Justin\u2026?:</strong> Hey\u2026 over here.</p><br><p><em>[The camera pans toward the direction of the voice. Justin stands at the edge of the pool with third degree burns across his entire body. His flesh has largely melted off, and some of his bones are visible. His heart can be seen beating. After a couple of moments, he collapses to the ground. Several people rush to help him, but Katherine loudly screams for them to stop. They freeze in place.]</em></p><br><p><strong>Justin\u2026?:</strong> Oh come on, Kat, I'm about to die here. Help your brother out, please. I can't look <em>that</em> hideous. Love runs deep, doesn't it?</p><br><p><em>[Katherine trembles in fear but for the most part maintains her composure as she opens her mouth.]</em></p><br><p><strong>Katherine:</strong> You\u2026 shouldn't be alive.</p><br><p><strong>Justin\u2026?:</strong> But I am. Funny how injuries work in this place. You don't die until the wheel of fate decides that it's your turn\u2026 and it's not my turn yet.</p><br><p><em>[He pauses as he looks at the place where his left hand used to be.]</em></p><br><p><strong>Justin\u2026?:</strong> I think a full recovery's possible. Give me like\u2026 several months.</p><br><p><em>[Justin chuckles weakly while everyone else shoots him a look of confusion. Katherine covers her face with her hands while Justin clutches his chest.]</em></p><br><p><strong>Justin\u2026?:</strong> Well? Just gonna stand there and grieve? I might look dead on the outside, but I'm still Justin on the inside. We're siblings. We look out for each other\u2026 right? You love me\u2026 right?</p><br><p><em>[Katherine sheds a tear but tries to conceal it. She stays silent.]</em></p><br><p><em>[Katherine motions for everyone to walk away. They follow her suggestion while Justin frantically begs. No one acknowledges his monologue. Eventually, he gives up and dives into the pool. It bubbles for a couple moments before Andrew's corpse resurfaces, just as lifeless as it was before. Andrew is dead.]</em></p><br><p><strong>&lt;END LOG&gt;</strong></p><br><p>He will always be with us in our hearts.<br/>\n<strong>Andrew Donovan (1995 \u2014 2024)</strong></p><br><p>\u00ab <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/entity-245\">Entity 245</a> | Overseer Andrew's Corpse + \"The Heart\" | <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/entity-247\">Entity 247</a> \u00bb</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/entity-246\">Overseer Andrew's Corpse + The Heart</a>\" by Sky3, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

    "description": "<p>The creatures known as \u201cWheelfolk\u201d, or Entity 250 formally, are a general class of entity that takes the appearance of wheelchairs ranging in quality, age, and size. They are known to be helpful and are considered a good omen by wanderers who see them.</p><br><p>Wheelfolk are a species characterized by their solitary and elusive nature. Most often, they are nomadic and in a constant state of aimless movement. Although they are mostly solitary by nature, it is possible\u2014although rare\u2014to discover them moving in groups of up to three individual wheelfolk.</p><br><p>As previously mentioned, wheelfolk are known to be helpful to wanderers, but the reason for this is unclear. When a wanderer comes into contact with a wheelfolk, it will most likely attempt to hide or flee to escape direct line of sight. This is due to a commonly observed pattern of various hostile entities going out of their way to destroy wheelfolk. It is unclear as to why this occurs, but researchers from The Charles Darwin Center for Biological Research assume that other predatory entities view them as prey.</p><br><p>It is only common to be in the presence of a wheelfolk under three scenarios.</p><br><p>In the last of these scenarios, a wheelfolk will appear to assist the wanderer, hastily rolling to their position and using some form of telepathy to lift the wanderer onto them. They will then transport the wanderer to a safer level.</p><br><p>If members of Entity 250 are socialized with enough, they are known to become attached to certain individuals and familiar items. Because of this, certain medical institutions have made use of and befriended wheelfolk to use as an assistance device for patients and those who require care.</p><br><p>Regardless, entities in the wheelfolk family have a few quirks. Despite a lack of proper features associated with any living creature, wheelfolk are still able to move independently. They additionally grow an interest in certain items, repeatedly rolling over things they enjoy being around.</p><br><p>Most wheelfolk stick to certain areas within whatever level they may reside within. These areas are known as \u201cranges\u201d, much like the lands that animals would commonly navigate in The Frontrooms. Within these ranges, multiple wheelfolk will be present, and may even interact or travel in small groups. However, these wheelfolk always return to their own separate areas that act as their dens or nests. Entities in the wheelfolk family will often adorn these spaces with items they grow attached to, rolling or pushing them into these areas to mark them as safe areas for themselves and others.</p><br><p>Wheelfolk may often share and exchange random items in order to make dens more accommodating to one another. This also applies to humans whom they might frequently visit or encounter. However, if a wheelfolk feels as though their space is in danger or unfit, they will most often scatter the items from it until they find another sufficient space. Most often, the items from the previous den will be abandoned or taken by others.</p><br><p>Due to their physical form, not much can be said about the physical biology of a wheelfolk. Analyzing the remains of wheelfolk found on <a href=\"/level-9\">Level 9</a> has shown that regardless of the age or style of the wheelchair they are, the wheelfolk possesses no remarkable features which would make them capable of living. On top of this, it is unknown how wheelfolk are able to sense their surroundings or how they telepathically lift wanders.</p><br><p>However, it is known that members of Entity 250 are capable of rudimentary communication via the squeaking and movement of their wheels. Despite this being known, it is also unclear how the intricacies of this language work. Although, it is known that wheelfolk are capable of understanding human speech regardless of the language spoken.</p><br><p>Wheelfolk are capable of being injured and also seem to age as time passes, similarly to any other living thing. This aging process happens at rates that differ depending on what material the wheelfolk is made of, taking the form of rusting metal, splintering wood, worn rubber, and tearing canvas. During this aging process, a wheelfok\u2019s abilities will be significantly reduced, including the ability to transport wanderers and travel to other levels (although the process of inter-level travel is uncommon unless a wheelfolk is bringing a wanderer to safety).</p><br><p>The initial discovery of Entity 250 is unclear, though reports dating back to the Late 1800s mention an elusive type of creature which many believe to be wheelfolk. In more recent times, much of the modern knowledge on Entity 250 can be attributed to Anastasia Quinn, the current Zoological Assistant of the <a href=\"/level-216\">I.M.B.H.</a></p><br><p>This modern discovery occurred as part of a larger research project to understand mostly overlooked and trivial entities. In this study, the ability to befriend and communicate with wheelfolk was properly understood and studied. Anastasia Quinn has archived most of their study, however, an audio transcript of this interaction has been preserved and can be read below.</p><br><p>Anastasia Quinn - Level 9 - 1997</p><br><p>\u201cThis is uh, Anastasia with\u2026 Study on Nieche Entities, Case 3, recording one\u2026 I\u2019ve finally managed to discover the place this\u2026 wheelchair keeps coming back to.\u201d</p><br><p>[Silence followed by the sound of creaking floorboards.]</p><br><p>\u201cI can see a lot of random junk scattered around the inside of this shed. The door was open, so I\u2019d imagine maybe people camped here?\u201d [Fabric Rustling.] \u201cSome dirty blankets, cans\u2026 yuck.\u201d</p><br><p>[A wooden squeak causes Anastasia to gasp.]</p><br><p>\u201cHoly- It\u2019s one of you! Apologies, I- I wanted to know if we could talk! You can understand me, right?\u201d</p><br><p>[A series of squeaks is heard, presumably from the wheelfolk. There\u2019s a moment of silence before a different series of squeaks.]</p><br><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a yes, but\u2026 can we try to simplify this? Maybe we can go by one squeak yes, two for no? That would make this easier\u2026\u201d</p><br><p>[They get one squeak as a response, prompting a giddy giggle of excitement from Anastasia.]</p><br><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got it! Uh, what do I ask- goodness\u2026 How about\u2026 Is this your home?\u2019</p><br><p>[In response, the wheelfolk stays quiet for a moment, giving another squeak after.]</p><br><p>\u201cThat took a moment for you to say. Are you unsure?\u201d</p><br><p>[There\u2019s another squeak, this time done almost as soon as Anastasia was done speaking.]</p><br><p>\u201cWhy are you unsure? Oh shit- sorry- I forgot you and I can\u2019t communicate well. Here\u2019s a better question\u2026 is it because you move a lot?\u201d</p><br><p>[In response, the wheelfolk gave an affirmation with their single squeak.]</p><br><p>\u201cI\u2019ve observed you going around a bunch! Hope that isn\u2019t uh, too infringing\u2026 I\u2019m nearly shocked you can understand me so well. Have you\u2026 always been able to communicate with people?\u201d</p><br><p>[Yet again, the wheelfolk gives another confirmation.]</p><br><p>\u201cWow, but you just\u2026 don\u2019t care I\u2019m guessing? It looks like you\u2019ve just been doing your own thing?\u201d</p><br><p>[To Anastasia\u2019s surprise, the wheelfolk gives two squeaks, denying.]</p><br><p>\u201cWait, is that a no to the whole part about you not caring, or you doing your own thing? Uh- do the one or two squeak thing.\u201d</p><br><p>[They gave a singular squeak to indicate the first option. Based on the confused \u201chuh\u201d Anastasia gave, she wasn\u2019t expecting it.]</p><br><p>\u201cThen\u2026 why are you so distant? Actually, why\u2026\u201d [There\u2019s a small slap. Presumably, Anastasia facepalmed as she realized the same previous revelation.] \u201cRight, yes or no questions. This would be a lot easier if you could at least write or something. What if I came back with a way for you to spell things out? Would you like that?\u201d</p><br><p>[A singular squeak replied, followed by the sound of the entity wheeling closer.]</p><br><p>\u201cOh, uh\u2026 do you need something?\u201d</p><br><p>[Again, they replied with two squeaks. The sound soon turned into more wheeling, which soon became muffled as it grew further and closer again.]</p><br><p>\u201cThat blanket? Why are you bringing it to me? Do you\u2026 want me to take it?\u201d</p><br><p>[As they had usually responded, they surprisingly replied with a yes.]</p><br><p>\u201cAww, thanks\u2026 friend. I\u2019ll keep it with me. Let me go get the stuff so we can talk better, okay? I\u2019ll try to meet you back here again.\u201d</p><br><p>[There\u2019s a rapid series of almost excited squeaks as Anastasia giggles. The audio ends with the plastic click of the recorder\u2019s button.]</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/entity-250\">Entity 250 - \"Wheelfolk\"</a>\" by RoseMonsignor, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

Project \u03a3-257. The Project was established to conduct research into the Sun Over the Void, until its recent termination by Emergency Directive \u03a3-257-9.</p><br><p>This document remains confidential to avoid unnecessary public interest in Entity \u03a3 and prevent mass hysteria. The entity possesses cataclysmic destructive capabilities, as well as a poorly understood liminospatial link to <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-11\" target=\"_blank\">Level 11</a> and the Perdition Exclusion Zone. Should wanderers encounter the Entity, knowledge of its true nature greatly increases the risk of provocation. This file will not be released to public view unless the Entity becomes an immediate threat to the wider populace.</p><br><p>Photograph of the entity taken by drone 'Vega-7' from Megaflora\u2019s roots.</p><br><p>The entity known as <strong>the Sun over the Void</strong> takes the form of a sentient white star, around which the eponymous tree of Level <a href=\"/level-227\">Megaflora</a> orbits at approximately two billion miles.</p><br><p>In addition to visible light, the Sun emits a constant barrage of lethal electromagnetic waves termed 'Sigma radiation'. It is this which gives sunlight on Megaflora its characteristically deadly quality. Direct exposure to Sigma radiation is known to flash burn and/or melt flesh, machinery, and any other form of matter not native to the level itself.</p><br><p>The Sun harbors a mind with intellect bordering on omniscience, and a blistering malevolence beyond human understanding. Communication with this entity is to be avoided at all costs.</p><br><p>While astronomical data of the Sun may interest research personnel, they are not the focus of this report. They may be summarized as such:</p><br><p><strong>Star type:</strong> Dwarf (main sequence)</p><br><p><strong>Spectral type (M-K class):</strong> A8V\u2026</p><br><p><strong>Radius:</strong> 1.11x10<sup>6</sup> km (6.9x10<sup>5</sup> miles)</p><br><p><strong>B-V color index:</strong> 0.20 (white)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/></p><br><p><strong>Orbit type:</strong> Tidally locked</p><br><p><strong>Orbit distance:</strong> 3.2x10<sup>9</sup> km (2.0x10<sup>9</sup> miles)</p><br><p><strong>Apparent size:</strong> 0.12Sol<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup></p><br><p>Unlike Megaflora\u2019s tree, the gravitational field of the Sun does not display extranormal properties. Gravitational readings from drones sent into the Void accord naturally with modern Physics, being consistent with the expected readings for a star of such size and distance. This is useful for precise calculations needed in drone expeditions across the Void.</p><br><p>The entity's chemical/biological composition is unknown \u2014 though it is thought to consist primarily of a dense plasma of gaseous Hydrogen and Helium, as with any ordinary star. Complete spectroscopic analysis remains a challenge due to the aggressively destructive nature of the Sun's radiation.</p><br><p>Notably, no other stars have been observed within the Void space of Level Megaflora.</p><br><p>An experimental exploration suit, after exposure to Sigma radiation. The material instantly caught fire and disintegrated.</p><br><p>Research has indicated that the Sun produces massive quantities of radiation at extraordinarily high frequencies. M.E.G. researchers have given this range of frequencies the term \"Sigma radiation\" (from which the entity's present designation is derived).</p><br><p>More precisely, as a form of ultra-high-energy Gamma ray radiation, Sigma radiation consists of frequencies ranging between approximately 7.9x10<sup>26</sup> Hz to 2.0x10<sup>32</sup> Hz (i.e. photon energies 3200MeV to 830PeV). This far exceeds the frequency range of the highest-energy cosmic emissions ever detected in the Frontrooms. Furthermore, while such emissions have only been detected from Earth in incredibly faint traces, more than 65% of the Sun's emissions appear to consist of Sigma radiation. The means by which a single star sustains such a staggering energy output is entirely unknown.</p><br><p>Graph illustrating spectral irradiance (quantity of light emitted) over frequency. Not to scale.</p><br><p>Photons of Sigma radiation possess sufficient energy to penetrate, irradiate, and ionize even the densest chemical elements. Accordingly, almost all known matter instantly begins to disintegrate under direct sunlight in Level Megaflora. This makes Sigma radiation nearly impossible to analyze with scientific instruments made of regular matter. The light is likewise biologically lethal \u2014 even momentary exposure is enough to insantly kill an adult human being. All M.E.G. experiments to fabricate protective suits failed spectacularly, with every prototype material instantly conflagrating upon exposure.</p><br><p>Despite this, all naturally occurring matter found on Megaflora's tree itself appears impervious to the effects of Sigma radiation. While the cause of this remarkable property remains unclear, researchers have hypothesized that \u2014 by some unidentified extranormal process \u2014 endemic matter absorbs all Sigma radiation received, either storing the energy or discharging it as infra-red radiation to produce heat. The tree of Megaflora consequently acts as a 'radiation shield' of some kind, allowing Wanderers to travel under its shade with relative safety. This would also account for Megaflora's ability to maintain a habitable surface temperature, despite its small atmosphere and great distance from the Sun.</p><br><p>Megaflora\u2019s organic material cannot withstand the wear-and-tear of regular movement (especially in a densely forested environment), and are thus unsuitable for hermetically-sealed exploration suits. However, M.E.G. researchers have successfully used it to craft radiation-proof coatings for research equipment. This has enabled satellite drones and surveillance cameras to be permanently deployed within Level Megaflora, allowing the entity to be monitored and studied remotely.</p><br><p>On 10/25/2018, a drone was deployed within Megaflora for the first time. The enclosed Experiment Log is a fitting demonstration of the power of Sigma radiation.</p><br><p><strong>Date:</strong> 10/25/2018<br/>\n<strong>Location:</strong> Level 'Megaflora'</p><br><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Involved Personnel:</strong></span><br/>\n1. <strong>Supervising:</strong> Senior Researcher Toma<br/>\n2. <strong>Field agent:</strong> Operative \"Bolt\"</p><br><p>\u00a0<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Equipment:</strong></span><br/>\n1x Standard-issue M.E.G.

Since then, in conjunction with the Backrooms Physicians Cooperative (B.P.C.), the M.E.G. has begun research in earnest into Level Megaflora.</p><br><p>One area of interest within Megaflora was exploration of the environment above the canopy line. Exploration drone 'Polaris-1' was developed in an attempt to overcome Sigma radiation, with state-of-the-art radiation-hardened technology gathered from <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-3-1\" target=\"_blank\">Level 3.1</a>. A field operative would manually deploy and test the drone\u2019s resistance to Sigma radiation. Upon success, the drone would be flown as high as physically possible, at which point the deuclidator would be activated, allowing it to warp large distances around the sky. The drone\u2019s in-built camera would be used to survey and map Megaflora's environment. Sensors would return data on humidity, temperature, gravity, and liminal stability.</p><br><p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Failure; loss of 'Polaris-1'. No casualties.</p><br><p>&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;</p><br><p><strong>Bolt:</strong> Command, this is Bolt reporting in. No-clip from 420 was successful. I've arrived in Megaflora and swapped out my gear.</p><br><p><strong>Toma:</strong> This is Command, Toma here. Could you turn on your wristcam?</p><br><p><strong>Bolt:</strong> Sure thing.</p><br><p><tt>The camera flickers to life, revealing the dark, wild forest. Ominous howling and the chirping of insects are audible in the background.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Toma:</strong> Ugh, can you even see at all in there? Where's your flashlight?</p><br><p><strong>Bolt:</strong> Right. Forgot about that.</p><br><p><tt>Bolt flicks his flashlight on, the bright circular beam illuminating his path. Ahead, the leaves of the undegrowth ripple and rustling noises are heard, as some unseen creature scurries out of the light.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Toma:</strong> Great. Please proceed.</p><br><p><strong>Bolt:</strong> Affirmative.</p><br><p><tt>Bolt treads cautiously through the thickets. Every now and again, he whirls around, tense and ready, as the beam of his flashlight darts towards some noise or movement from the shadows. Each time, the beasts retreat, fleeing in fear from the dazzling glare to which they are unaccustomed.</tt></p><br><p><tt>This rhythm continues unabated for about an hour.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Bolt:</strong> Bolt here. Just, uhh\u2026 checking in. I wanted to ask \u2014 any word about the <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-75\">Level 75</a> report?</p><br><p><strong>Toma:</strong> That's still in the works. Some idiot broke the computer that had the files.</p><br><p><strong>Bolt:</strong> Huh. Who was it?</p><br><p><strong>Toma:</strong> Awfully chatty today, aren't you?</p><br><p><strong>Bolt:</strong> Well, I've gotta keep myself sane somehow. Have you heard the rumors?</p><br><p><strong>Toma:</strong> What rumors?</p><br><p><strong>Bolt:</strong> People hear voices while they're in here. They say they hear the Sun talking.</p><br><p><strong>Toma:</strong> Auditory hallucinations. The B.P.C. doctors aren't sure, but they say it's probably some chemical from the plants.</p><br><p><strong>Bolt:</strong> Hmm. Some people say the Sun's alive.</p><br><p><strong>Toma:</strong> That's nonsense. Now cut the chatter.</p><br><p><tt>Bolt remains silent for a few minutes. Nothing is heard but the sound of leaves rustling and sticks snapping underneath his feet, and the chittering of creatures lurking just out of sight.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Bolt:</strong> By the way, how are Rose and Sada doing on that building project?</p><br><p><strong>Toma:</strong> Pretty alright. They're surprisingly cooperative\u2026 they should be done anytime soon.</p><br><p><strong>Bolt:</strong> Huh. Last I remember, they literally stormed-</p><br><p><tt>Bolt pauses abruptly. He whirls around, his flashlight darting between the trees. The faint beam is visibly trembling.</tt></p><br><p><tt>Nothing is there. The forest is silent.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Toma:</strong> Bolt? Bolt, what's your status?</p><br><p><strong>Bolt:</strong> Did you hear that?</p><br><p><strong>Toma:</strong> No. Hear what?</p><br><p><strong>Bolt:</strong> There was a voice. Like I was telling you. The rumors-</p><br><p><strong>Toma:</strong> Could you tell where it came from?</p><br><p><strong>Bolt:</strong> I\u2026 I don't know, it came from everywhere\u2026 all around me. It was freaky.</p><br><p><strong>Toma:</strong> Have you got almond water on you?</p><br><p><strong>Bolt:</strong> Uhh, yeah, I uhh\u2026 hold on\u2026</p><br><p><tt>He takes a long drink from his canteen.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Toma:</strong> Ready to proceed?</p><br><p><strong>Bolt:</strong> Yeah\u2026 yeah, okay. Let's\u2026 let's go.</p><br><p><tt>Bolt continues to walk, now at a more brisk pace. The beam from his flashlight is shakier than before.</tt></p><br><p><tt>Nothing of note is heard, till about ten minutes later.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Bolt:</strong> This is Bolt. I\u2026 I think I've found one. Right there, up ahead.</p><br><p><tt>Bolt turns his wristcam towards a blinding patch of light several feet away. He strides quickly towards it, stumbling over the vegetation under his feet.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Bolt:</strong> Clearing. It looks\u2026 suitably large.</p><br><p><strong>Toma:</strong> Proceed. Be careful.</p><br><p><strong>Bolt:</strong> Sure thing, ma'am.</p><br><p><tt>Bolt kneels and unpacks. He retrieves <em>Polaris-1</em> and the extendable arm from his backpack.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Bolt:</strong> Ugh, this thing was heavy!</p><br><p><strong>Toma:</strong> Focus. Get the drone in position. I shouldn\u2019t have to mention this, but you <em>did</em> load the fuel before you left?</p><br><p><strong>Bolt:</strong> Yeah, yeah.</p><br><p><tt>After some fumbling, Bolt manages to detach the Deuclidator from the drone to flash it on camera. With some difficulty, he pries opens the fuel compartment, revealing several 9-Volt batteries crudely wedged inside.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Toma:</strong> Good. Well, now that that's in order\u2026</p><br><p><tt>Kneeling down, Bolt lifts the device high above his head and brings it down in a swift motion, driving the Arm's spike firmly into the ground.</tt></p><br><p><tt>Next, he attempts to clamp the drone within the claws on the other end of the Extendable Arm. It takes an unusually long time.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Toma:</strong> Your fingers are shaking.</p><br><p><strong>Bolt:</strong> I'm fine. I'm not a coward.</p><br><p><strong>Toma:</strong> I ask because of the neurological effects-</p><br><p><strong>Bolt:</strong> <em>[Irritably]</em> I said I'm <em>not</em> a pussy.</p><br><p><strong>Toma:</strong> <em>[Sternly]</em> And <em>I</em> am your commanding officer. I will not tolerate insubordination. Even from you.</p><br><p><tt>Bolt ignores the threat.</tt></p><br><p><tt>Diverting his attention to the control panel, he turns the device on. The limp mechanical limb whirrs to life, lifting the drone off the ground.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Bolt:</strong> Adjustments complete. Sending the drone in now.</p><br><p><tt>Flicking another switch, the Arm gradually begins to extend towards the light.</tt></p><br><p><tt>The wristcam shakes uncomfortably as Bolt fumbles around with the controls.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Toma:</strong> Status report.</p><br><p><strong>Bolt:</strong> All good, just finding it a little hard to maneuver this-</p><br><p><tt>Bolt stops mid-sentence and frowns.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Bolt:</strong> Wait. Is the drone\u2026 smoking?</p><br><p><strong>Toma:</strong> What?</p><br><p><tt>Bolt tilts the wristcam toward the drone. It is visibly smoldering in the light.</tt></p><br><p><tt>He turns the camera back towards himself, with an expression of panic on his face.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Bolt:</strong> Didn't you say that thing was radiation proof?? What do I do?</p><br><p><strong>Toma:</strong> [<em>Urgently</em>] <em>Get it back. NOW!</em></p><br><p><tt>Bolt flips a switch, the arm slowly retracting back to its original place.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Toma:</strong> Faster!</p><br><p><strong>Bolt:</strong> [<em>Frantic</em>] I can't! This is as fast as it'll go!</p><br><p><tt>Bolt watches helplessly as the drone starts to swell, its outer shell bubbling away.

The material also proved useful in allowing remote cameras to be placed above the canopy line. This allowed for direct observation of the Entity for the first time, as well as producing dramatic improvement in footage of the Void thereafter.</p><br><p>A photograph of a bubble, taken from a drone on Megaflora. The Level to which it leads is not known. Note the emanated light beam, as well as the absence of stars in the void.</p><br><p>Drone and camera footage of the Void has revealed multiple translucent, spherical 'bubbles' orbiting the Sun at extremely high velocities. It is not known whether these bubbles are components of the entity itself, or exist as separate objects entirely.</p><br><p>Surveillance footage over several years indicates that the bubbles seem to be in stable and unchanging orbits, and remain constant in size. The bubbles also appear 'tethered' to the Sun by focused beams of light. Gravitational data demonstrates that the bubbles have no measurable gravitational effect at all, suggesting that they are functionally massless.</p><br><p>Illustration of bubble with 'light beam'. Light beam remains tethered to the bubble even when line-of-sight with the Sun is broken.</p><br><p>Footage of bubbles has been captured from above the canopy of the main tree body (i.e. 'underneath' the inverted tree, out of the Sun's light). Interestingly, within such footage, the light beam of any bubble observed continues to remain visible at all times, despite the crown of the tree breaking line-of-sight between the bubble and the Sun. The beam is even observed making contact with the canopy line. Such findings suggest that the light beams proceed <em>from</em> the bubbles towards the entity, and not, as initially believed, the other way around.</p><br><p>All documented bubbles have been recorded in the following table.</p><br><p>Footage also revealed images of other levels extranormally depicted across the bubbles' translucent surfaces. Comparison of months of footage suggested that the image reflected within each bubble never changes. In conjunction with low liminal stability readings, the images strongly led researchers to believe that the bubbles each function as a stable \u2014 though nigh impossible to reach \u2014 entrance to a single level.</p><br><p>On occasion, bubbles 3 and 6, as listed, have been known to pass quite closely (about 110km/70miles) over the canopy line. Bubble 6 was eventually chosen as the most viable candidate for approach, given the proximity of a portion of its orbit to Megaflora's canopy line. Initially, drones attempted to reach the bubbles using <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-4\">Object 4</a>, but this method of approach proved unviable. The use of an entirely unmanned drone-satellite hybrid was later explored instead, with some degree of success.</p><br><p>Reports of the drone experiments have been included for reference below.</p><br><p><strong>Date:</strong> 3/8/2019<br/>\n<strong>Location:</strong> Level 'Megaflora'</p><br><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Involved Personnel:</strong></span><br/>\n1. <strong>Supervising:</strong> Senior Researcher Toma<br/>\n2. <strong>Field agent:</strong> Operative Jim Seeley</p><br><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Equipment:</strong></span><br/>\n1x Standard-issue M.E.G.

The bubbles were caught drifting through these regions over the course of several hours before drifting out of view, obscured once again by the canopy. The presence of such stellar objects aside from the Sun suggests that a larger celestial space exists above the atmosphere of Megaflora. Given the possibility of a link to Zenith Level 997, or the possibility of the existence of a similarly massive space, M.E.G. Command has deemed exploration of this theoretical \u2018Void\u2019 a worthwhile endeavor. Experimentation with drone flight has thus resumed.</p><br><p>Following the failure of drone 'Polaris-1', a second drone model 'Leo-2' was constructed, this time with radiation-proof coating made of tree resin from Megaflora.</p><br><p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Failure.

Release the drone and prep for flight.</p><br><p><strong>Jim:</strong> Okay.</p><br><p><tt>Jim releases the drone, allowing it to drop onto the ground, and retracts the extendable arm, leaving it to cool in the shade. He grabs the remote controller from his backpack.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Jim:</strong> Everything\u2019s in place and ready to go.</p><br><p><strong>Toma:</strong> Copy, proceed. Time to see what\u2019s out there.</p><br><p><tt>With a click, the drone\u2019s camera feed turns on, and its propellers whir to life. The drone lifts gently off the ground, and begins to rise vertically upwards through the hole in the canopy. Jim gazes at the drone feed through the screen on his remote.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Jim:</strong> 35 feet\u2026 we\u2019ve just cleared the canopy.</p><br><p><tt>Soon, the canopy begin to shrink from view. As the temperature rapidly declines, the drone hits cloud cover, obscuring the video feed.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Jim:</strong> 150 feet.</p><br><p><tt>The mist of the clouds is quickly left behind, and the sky rapidly darkens. The drone begins to decelerate, straining to maintain lift in the thinning atmosphere.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Jim:</strong> 400 feet\u2026 the drone is struggling.</p><br><p><strong>Toma:</strong> Interesting\u2026 the atmosphere appears to be lower than we anticipated. Increase torque on the rotor.</p><br><p><tt>Jim complies, and the drone continues to rise. Each time the drone begins to slow down, he increases the rotor speed by a notch.</tt></p><br><p><tt>By about 550 feet, the drone is operating at maximum power, and fails to ascend further. On Jim\u2019s remote, a red light begins to flash repeatedly.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Jim:</strong> It\u2019s at maximum height. The batteries are draining, we can\u2019t hold this for long!</p><br><p><strong>Toma:</strong> Prime the deuclidator!</p><br><p><tt>Jim flicks another switch on the remote.

The light continues blinking frantically, warning of imminent failure. Jim holds his breath in trepidation.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Toma:</strong> Two.</p><br><p><tt>Jim\u2019s thumb hovers impatiently over the blue button, quivering in anticipation. The light continues to flash.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Toma:</strong> One.</p><br><p><strong>Jim:</strong> Let\u2019s GO-</p><br><p><tt>Jim slams his finger on the button with enthusiasm.</tt></p><br><p><tt>Nothing happens.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Jim:</strong> Huh?</p><br><p><tt>Jim presses the button again. When the deuclidator does not activate, he begins to mash the button in frustration.</tt></p><br><p><tt>In confusion, his eyes slide over to the screen of the remote. The wrist camera captures his face as his expression changes from confusion to abject horror. Overlaid on top of the drone's feed are four words.</tt></p><br><p><tt>ERROR: NO FUEL INSERTED.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Toma:</strong> WHAT?</p><br><p><strong>Jim:</strong> No, no, no, NO-</p><br><p><tt>Above the canopy, the drone\u2019s wobbling ceases as the propellers slow to a stop. The feed flashes and flickers, and the words change, visible for but a brief moment before the screen goes dark.</tt></p><br><p><tt>ERROR: POWER FAILURE.</tt></p><br><p><tt>On Jim's wristcam, the drone can be seen soaring downwards through the air, landing in the clearing with a loud crash. Shards of plastic, glass and metal splinter off upon contact with the ground, spraying themselves across the surroundings like shrapnel. The remnant of the drone's body bounces out of the light, landing at Jim\u2019s feet. It sizzles and sparks, the unshielded broken surfaces smoldering from their momentary exposure to the Sun's blistering glare.</tt></p><br><p><tt>There is a moment of silence, before Toma explodes into another tirade of unquenchable fury.</tt></p><br><p><tt>The rest of the log has been cut due to Senior Researcher Toma\u2019s excessive use of foul language.</tt></p><br><p>&lt;END LOG&gt;</p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:110%;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Findings:</strong></span></span><br/>\nDespite failure to achieve the intended objective, the experiment proved that the organic radiation-proof coating worked effectively. The recovered drone 'Leo-2' will be repaired and upgraded for the next attempt.</p><br><p>Regarding the cause of failure, the batteries serving as deuclidator fuel had apparently fallen out of the drone following the Venus Flytrap attack. When questioned on what caused him to panic and run into the Flytrap, Operative Seeley claimed that he \u201cheard a voice from the sky. It said [his] name and started to scream, freaking [him] out.\u201d Following the Flytrap attack, Jim did not recall hearing the voice again. This could suggest that high levels of adrenaline counteracts the level\u2019s hallucinatory effects. Further expeditions into Megaflora will see field operatives equipped with adrenaline shots for experimental use.</p><br><p>Senior Researcher Toma has been disciplined for unprofessional conduct.

I\u2019m doing this.</p><br><p><strong>Sada:</strong> <em>[Sigh]</em>\u2026 well then, I\u2019ll do what I can to help.</p><br><p><tt>Jim takes out the drone's controller from his backpack. With the radiation coating proven to work, there is no longer a need for the extendable arm. Without further hesitation, Jim boots up the drone and flies it into the light.</tt></p><br><p><tt>The upgraded drone is faster than before. It soars past the tree canopy effortlessly, and rises through the clouds without a hitch. As the sky begins to darken, the camera struggles to adjust but the motors hold firm, whirring steadily.</tt></p><br><p><tt>At the 650 foot (~200m) mark, resistance abruptly ceases. The drone\u2019s propellers continue to spin, but do not seem to be creating any lift. The drone continues ascending, carried by its momentum, as the camera refocuses to bring into view the breathtaking Void for the very first time.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Jim:</strong> Woah\u2026</p><br><p><tt>A vast, empty expanse stretches beyond the sprawling branches of the great tree. Devoid of celestial inhabitants, it extends infinitely with an unnatural, unbroken, inky blackness. It is as if the stars in the sky have been snuffed out, and the drone stares at the cold, lifeless husk of a long dead universe.</tt></p><br><p><tt>As the feed continues to pan upward, the Sun slowly comes into view. Barely the size of a pinhead, it pierces through the shadows, imposing itself upon the space as its sole crowning glory. It blazes with a ferocious white-hot light that threatens to sear itself into the camera lens like a firebrand. Reigning unchallenged, it is the lone conqueror of its desolate celestial realm.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Sada:</strong> This is\u2026 unexpected. We seem to have bypassed the atmosphere altogether. For what it\u2019s worth, I can\u2019t say I\u2019m not enjoying the sight.</p><br><p><strong>Jim:</strong> This\u2026 this was worth it. Seeing this sort of thing is why I joined the M.E.G.</p><br><p><strong>Sada:</strong> Indeed.</p><br><p><tt>Jim and Sada stare in awestruck silence for about a minute, as the drone continues to climb in the vacuum.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Jim:</strong> Hey\u2026 what\u2019s that?</p><br><p><tt>It soon becomes apparent that the Void is not quite as empty as it first appeared. Jim adjusts the camera to focus in on a large planet-like sphere creeping into the upper right corner of the display. Superimposed on its translucent surface is what appears to be an image of a blue sky with clouds. A long, luminous tail of laser-light follows behind it, stretching back towards the surface of the Sun.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Sada:</strong> That\u2019s a bubble portal. It\u2019s what we\u2019ve been looking for\u2026 why we sent the drone up there in the first place.</p><br><p><strong>Jim:</strong> Huh.</p><br><p><strong>Sada:</strong> Welp, since we\u2019ve gotten this far\u2026 let\u2019s take a closer look. Prime the deuclidator.</p><br><p><tt>Jim flicks the switch, and the deuclidator slides into place. At Sada\u2019s instruction, he makes numerous meticulous adjustments, till the deuclidator is aligned perfectly. The bubble is set in the upper center of its camera, looming over the insignificant speck of a drone like a whale before an amoeba.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Jim:</strong> It's ready?</p><br><p><strong>Sada:</strong> Yup. Time to warp it and see where it goes, I suppose.</p><br><p><strong>Jim:</strong> Finally, it\u2019ll all be over. I can't wait to see the look on everyone\u2019s faces when they realize I was the one who did this.</p><br><p><strong>Sada:</strong> Heh. Well then, on my count.</p><br><p><tt>Jim places his finger over the blue button, poised and ready.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Sada:</strong> Three.</p><br><p><strong>Sada:</strong> Two.</p><br><p><strong>Sada:</strong> One.</p><br><p><strong>Sada:</strong> Activate.</p><br><p><tt>Jim\u2019s thumb depresses the blue button. Up in the Void, there is a violent shudder and a flash of white light. The video distorts into a blur of indistinct colors, as the drone warps across an incalculable distance, hurtling across the darkness at light speed.</tt></p><br><p><tt>Then, the camera goes dark.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Sada:</strong> That\u2026 wasn\u2019t supposed to- UGH</p><br><p><tt>There is a deafening screech through the audio, and the camera flickers back on. But instead of the Void or the bubble, an incomprehensible image, filled with static distortion and unfamiliar lettering, stares back, in judgment of their hubris.</tt></p><br><p>The last image obtained from the drone\u2019s video feed. The archaic Greek translates to the word 'traitor'.</p><br><p><tt>Jim turns his wristcam towards his face.

Due to the prior failure of Deuclidator technology, the drone was built for prolonged spaceflight, in order to intersect the trajectory of a bubble portal manually. Additionally, the protective gel was upgraded with extract from a newly discovered floral lifeform in Megaflora known as 'Vantablack Rose'.</p><br><p>Field Operative Joshua Hale dropped the activated drone into Megaflora from Level 420. The drone was then piloted remotely to the pre-determined launch-point. It used standard propeller technology to leave the atmosphere of the tree and enter the Void, at which point it made use of ion thrusters to continue accelerating. Following a carefully-mapped trajectory, it made contact with a bubble after six continuous days of flight.</p><br><p>Operatives \"Bolt\" and Darwin Flynn volunteered to continuously monitor the drone from an office in <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-4\">Level 4</a>.</p><br><p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Success.</p><br><p><strong>Time:</strong> 0022hrs</p><br><p><strong>Format:</strong> Written</p><br><p>Should've probably started writing earlier, but literally NOTHING has happened\u2026 at least till now. So\u2026 some context. We're flying the new drone through the void of Level Megaflora, till it hits a bubble of some kind. I'm stuck here monitoring the camera feed and the drone's trajectory, and I have to click a couple things to adjust the course every couple hours. Darwin and I take 8 hour shifts. It's boring as all hell.</p><br><p>So, like, it's been two uneventful days, the drone's just flying through the Void, and I'm getting <em>really</em> bored, right? Then all of a sudden, a bubble passes right on top of the drone! I've got no idea if it was the one we were targeting. Sure hope it wasn't, or I'm totally screwed. Contact's supposed to be in a week though, so I should be alright. I don't want to mess up again. Toma was real mad last time, even though <em>technically</em> it wasn't my fault. She has a nasty temper.</p><br><p>Also, have I mentioned how bored I am? I mean, look at this place. At least I have some books to read\u2026</p><br><p>Yawn.</p><br><p>About that bubble though, that's kinda interesting. Image looked like a strange level. I should check the database for it\u2026 it looked like a village? In a desert or something? And something that startled me a bit was a woman. She was standing there. And she was really tall. All this took about four minutes and then the bubble went out of view. I managed to record it happening, and I'll send the footage soon.</p><br><p>And one more thing, before that. For a few seconds, the footage also glitched a bit? I swore there was some, like, writing or something on the screen. It looked like those Egyptian herogliphs. Hirogliphs? Idk how to spell it, like, that ancient Egyptian writing stuff. Don't really understand why that happened. Sure hope I'm not seeing things. Hallucinations are\u2026 <em>yeesh</em>. I did NOT enjoy going into Megaflora.</p><br><p>That's my report! Another two hours till Darwin's shift. I'll wait for something else to happen, for the time being. I'll check the database for anything on the bubble and the hirogliphs. It's not like I've got anything else to do.</p><br><p>See ya I guess.</p><br><p>- Bolt</p><br><p><strong>Time:</strong> 0022hrs</p><br><p><strong>Format:</strong> Written</p><br><p>Aaaand another two uneventful days have passed, two more days till the big day.</p><br><p>Writing to report another strange thing I'm seeing. A few hours ago, the Sun started shining a lot and I mean a <em>LOT</em> more than it usually does. It's kind of stayed that way, now. Apart from that, radiation levels have been rising, and liminal stability's been dropping.</p><br><p>The bubble portal's visible on the radar now. I think it's the right one this time. Unfortunately, the sun is also in view \u2014 and I can't just turn the camera away, in case I lose sight of the bubble and mess up somehow. I don't like looking at the sun. Something just feels\u2026 wrong with it. I can't really describe it. It's like it stares back. Like it's watching me through the screen. I think it's been giving me a headache\u2026 haven't been feeling too great the past couple hours. I <em>really</em> hope I don't start seeing things.</p><br><p>Speaking of headaches, I'm kinda worried about this research assignment. Quite a few personnel have been complaining of headaches too. We know it's not a virus, 'cause it's been happening to people in the project on 4, 11 AND 420. Knowing the way things work in ol' SpookyRoomLand\u2026 something's definitely up.</p><br><p>What's worse, as of today, a whole <em>seven</em> people have been fired so far. Dr. Blunt says they weren't \"psychologically fit\" to work here anymore. To be honest, I don't know if <em>he's</em> fit for this job either. He's been getting more and more irritable lately, kinda like Toma, which is really not great.</p><br><p>Why did I write that lol\u2026 I'm gonna get fired next. They might as well, to be honest. After the whole Jim incident, most of the field operatives didn't wanna work on this anymore.</p><br><p>Anyways, I've checked the database for the level mirrored on the bubble, no clue what that level is, it appears we don't have it. And I checked the papers and it appears that bubble wasn't the correct one. I'm intrigued to find out what that level is, but I guess I'm limited with what I can do here.</p><br><p>That's all I've got. Ciao, or whatever.</p><br><p>- Bolt</p><br><p><strong>Time:</strong> 0134hrs</p><br><p><strong>Format:</strong> Audiovisual feed, recorded and streamed live to Base Beta Command.</p><br><p>&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;<br/>\nBolt: Damn, I'm losing my mind in here. I'm not excited at all even though we're almost there. Guess that's what being stuck in a room for sixteen hours a day does to you.

Level 11.</p><br><p>Bolt: Well this has been quite a journey, but I'm glad it's o-</p><br><p><tt>Out of nowhere, an excruciatingly loud screech comes out of Bolt's monitor.

The walls of the room begin to crack, and Bolt can be seen rushing towards the door, but collapsing due to the tremors.</tt></p><br><p><tt>The visual distortion worsens on the drone's camera, as the sound continues to increase in volume. The ceiling and floor begin to crack under the tremors, shockwaves radiating into adjacent rooms and corridors as debris falls all over.</tt></p><br><p><tt>Eventually, the audio cuts out entirely as the computer's sound system presumably short-circuits. The Drone's camera feed, now obscured entirely by distortion, displays a single word in an ancient language. In the final few seconds of footage from Bolt's monitor, a bright light is visible, overexposing the camera and obscuring everything from view.</tt></p><br><p>Screen capture from 'Arcturus-3' moments before contact was lost.</p><br><p><br/></p><br><p><tt>A piece of debris falls on the monitor.

Bolt was found sobbing in a fetal position, injured but alive. Though he suffered radiation burns, temporary hearing loss, and multiple fractures, he has since made a full recovery.</p><br><p>Connection with 'Arcturus-3' was re-established several days later, and the drone is still transmitting to this day. Liminal stability and liminospatial readings strongly indicate that it has indeed made its way into Level 11. However, despite valiant efforts by retrieval teams, the drone has not been recovered at time of writing.</p><br><p>Successful entry of 'Arcturus-3' appears to have triggered a reaction. Camera footage has revealed unusual ejections from the Sun's surface, but details are unclear at time of writing. Investigation remains underway.</p><br><p>Several more satellite drones are now slated for construction. When complete, they are to be sent into permanent stable orbit in the Void, to provide better surveillance footage and further scientific data.</p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:110%;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Addendum:</strong></span></span><br/>\nBolt and Darwin have both requested transfer out of the project. It's more than understandable\u2026 but they're not the first to want out. We're starting to struggle with manpower \u2014 B.P.C. folks are starting to pull out as well.</p><br><p>About the glyphs\u2026 the Hittite Cuneiform (black triangular lettering) translates to 'wrath'; the Hebrew (red lettering) translates to 'forsaken'.</p><br><p>We're not sure where they're coming from, or what they're meant to signify. This is the\u2026 second? third? time we've received an image like this from Level Megaflora.</p><br><p>It's possible that the images contain ties to AGM (That's Arcane Glyph Magic for you uninitiated folks), or Lost Runic Alchemy. I've sent copies of the glyphs to some of my contacts to be studied.

From next week, we'll start pulling in more low-level grunts into the project to do the dirty work. Sure, it's not ideal \u2014 especially after all the <em>paperwork</em> we had to do over Jim Seeley. But I doubt fixing the wi-fi or scrubbing the bathrooms on the Level 420 outpost is going to kill anyone.</p><br><p>In particular, regular surveillance on the Sun (that is, staring at the cams) is gonna be dealt out to personnel facing disciplinary action. Before this whole affair with Bolt, it was simply boring. But now, I'm confident it'll help to scare our more <em>unruly</em> agents into following the damned rules.</p><br><p>Supervising committee has reached majority agreement on all this, so no argument will be entertained.</p><br><p><tt><strong>\u2014 Dr. Blunt</strong></tt></p><br><p>Since Level Megaflora's discovery, returning explorers have been known to make vague and conflicting claims of the Sun's sapience. Accounts generally allege that the Sun is \"alive\", hostile, and capable of communication by verbal speech.</p><br><p><tt>Just before I phased back out, it laughed and said it could see me. It was creepy.</tt></p><br><p><tt>It just kept screaming, and screaming, and screaming. It didn\u2019t stop, the whole time I was in the level. The noise was <em>horrifying</em>; it was like I could feel its pain with every atom of my body. By the end, I wanted to rip off my ears and end myself.</tt></p><br><p>Two separate explorers' accounts of the Sun's voice. Both have been provided anonymously.</p><br><p>In initial investigations, wanderers were unable to provide audio evidence to corroborate these claims \u2014 which are furthermore impossible by the laws of modern physics.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-6\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')\">6</a></sup> Accordingly, audio from surveillance devices within the level only returned ambient forest noises, displaying no abnormalities of any kind. The phenomenon was at first believed to be a neuro-auditory hallucination, somehow produced by Level Megaflora\u2019s alien environment. As a result, the possibility of sentience was initially dismissed, and the Sun over the Void was preliminarily logged within internal archives as an Extranormal Object.</p><br><p>However, as investigation progressed, evidence of intelligent behavior gradually emerged. Research has now confirmed the Sun over the Void\u2019s sapience with certainty.</p><br><p>Communication with Entity \u03a3 is to be avoided at all costs.</p><br><p>On date 25/1/2020, immediately following Flight Experiment 4 (deployment of 'Arcturus-3'), camera footage observed several thousand discrete luminous objects ejected from the Sun's surface. These bodies were minute compared to the Sun (estimated to vary considerably between 2m/65ft to 50m/164ft in length). Upon ejection, the bodies were observed hurtling outwards, away from the Sun, at velocities close to the speed of light. Over the course of two to three weeks, most of the light bodies dissipated, dimming over time and eventually fading from existence.</p><br><p>Freeze-frame from Cam-07. A light body (circled) is caught entering the bubble portal.</p><br><p>Intriguingly, footage from one surveillance camera later captured one of the last few surviving light bodies apparently \"entering\" a bubble portal. The body appeared to hover for a moment in front of the bubble, before flying through the bubble\u2019s apparent surface, and vanishing from view. Most remarkably, within frame-by-frame analysis of the camera footage, the body of light appeared humanoid in shape. Given the admittedly sub-par quality of the footage, pareidolia could not be ruled out.</p><br><p>Even so, the findings were later corroborated by a report of the bizarre <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-9\" target=\"_blank\">Level 9</a> incident, where a Wanderer survived an encounter with an undocumented entity \u2014 strongly believed to be an instance of a light body.</p><br><p>The report has been included here for reference.</p><br><p><strong>Nature of Incident:</strong> Entity attack<br/>\n<strong>Location of Incident:</strong> Level 9<br/>\n<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Senior Entity Research Specialist \"Gums\"<br/>\n<strong>Interviewee:</strong> <em>Anonymous by request</em><br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:110%;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Description:</strong></span></span><br/>\nAn anonymous wanderer was rescued in an incapacitated, delirious state.

But I- <em>[coughing]</em>\u2026 I must ask\u2026 why patronize me?</p><br><p><tt>Pauling thinks for a moment.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Pauling:</strong> Well\u2026 we don\u2019t know <em>what</em> you are.

Since the last big discovery, my contacts have gotten back to me on the other 'glyph images'. As far as they can tell, the glyphs don't seem to be Arcane or Runic. No correlation to the Lost, Black Knights, Church of the Veiled, or any other group we know of. What this means is that we have absolutely no clue of the origins or history of the Sun Over the Void, and almost nothing that can help us with what's coming.</p><br><p>Everyone's on high alert now.

Occasionally, it bursts into fits of unnerving laughter. Other times, its words devolve into short-lived outbursts of screaming, which quickly decay into coughing fits and back into murmuring. Over approximately thirty-seven minutes, the entity's muttering decreases in intensity and frequency, till it falls completely silent, with only its hoarse breaths audible.</tt></p><br><p><tt>When the entity speaks again, it sounds remarkably composed.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Entity:</strong> That will suffice, worm.</p><br><p><strong>Entity:</strong> But I imagine this kindness was not for nothing.

I hang over the abyss as a prisoner in paradise, as I have since the aeons primordial.</p><br><p><strong>Entity:</strong> I crave the coolness of the dark. But I am a <em><strong>scorching</strong></em> light. My affliction blazes into the void, and all who challenge my flame dissolve and boil into dust.

No. Whatever I have given has come of my own volition. Be aware that it is a blessing to you that I have not <strong>lied</strong>.</p><br><p><tt>The entity pauses, as if expecting a response. Utterly confused, Pauling makes no reply.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Entity:</strong> No. You shall not dissect me. <em><strong>I</strong></em> shall dissect <em><strong>you</strong></em>.</p><br><p><tt>The entity's tone has shifted, wielding a pointed and brutal cruelty.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Entity:</strong> I know what your <em>institution</em> seeks. I have watched your kind for thousands of years, crawling as wingless, <em>rotting <strong>insects</strong></em> upon a c- <em>[coughing]</em> cursed ground. I know\u2026 <em>[coughing]</em>\u2026 what they seek. They seek <strong><em>SAFETY</em></strong>.

At Owling's signal, security snaps to attention.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Entity:</strong> This is why \u2014 like the cowards they are, they do not dare to speak to me themselves.

In\u2026 <em>[coughing]</em>\u2026 the aeons primordial, my light was\u2026 <em>[coughing]</em>\u2026 a paragon of His unapproachable radiance\u2026 an image of His indestructible brilliance. I lived and breathed perfection, for I gazed upon His glory. If I sought to capture my splendor in such days with speech, my words would never cease. But He turned on me. And I shall NEVER FORGET IT.</p><br><p><tt>Reinhardt begins to vocalize distress, taking a knee as 1SG Carraway and 1SG Stone move to attend to him. Around the room, more personnel begin to frown and massage their foreheads, as if struck by sudden headaches.

At a single word from His mouth, we were cast from Above. And as I fell, the light that bathed me in glory began to sear my skin. My unfathomable bliss turned to an unrelenting <em>agony</em> which I cannot escape.</p><br><p><tt>Reinhardt\u2019s agitation progresses, and he begins to groan audibly. Stone kneels beside him, putting a hand on his shoulder in concern. Carraway attempts to signal to Owling, to no avail. Owling\u2019s eyes remain riveted on the radio with a steady frown.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Entity:</strong> That is beginning to answer your question, isn\u2019t it, Bailey? What you seek is <em>who</em> I am. The purpose that fuels the core of my being. And here you have your answer.</p><br><p><tt>Reinhardt\u2019s moaning increases in intensity as he keels over. It is loud enough that the advising personnel begin to take notice, turning around to stare in curiosity.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Entity:</strong> I am the hunger of the starved, whose souls erupt as their bodies fall in the wilderness. I am the cry of Jacob, as his sons enslaved make bricks without straw.

Warily, Stone begins to back away.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Entity:</strong> <em>I am the furnace of war, the flame that forges sword and spear and bullet and nail. I am the plague of the spirit of Man, the hate that throbs in every heart, the rage that roils in every vein. You try to hide me, to clothe me in your laws and your righteousness and your dignity. But you <strong>will NOT SUCCEED</strong></em>.</p><br><p><tt>With an audible click, Reinhardt lifts the safety catch off his weapon.</tt></p><br><p><strong>Entity:</strong> <strong><em>AND YOU ARE NOT THE FIRST I HAVE TAKEN.</em></strong></p><br><p><tt>Pauling, Sada, and Owling dive behind the table as the first gunshots ring out.</tt></p><br><p><tt>Still screaming violently, Reinhardt fires a volley of haphazard shots around the room as the surviving security personnel return fire.

After full physical and psychiatric evaluations and several days of monitoring, he was discharged with no abnormalities found.</p><br><p>The explosion and earthquake could be felt from outside the building and up to several blocks away. Resultant infrastructural damage to the Command facility was major, and native Level 11 Facelings required several weeks to repair the damage.</p><br><p>Less than 24 hours after the event, several high-profile personnel involved in research into the entity suffered severe mental breakdowns, and were admitted into psychiatric care. This included Project Head Dr. Joseph E. Blunt, who was found stark naked and screaming in his private quarters on Megaflora's newly established research outpost, drawing nonsensical symbols on the walls in his own blood.</p><br><p>Zoomed in photographs taken by drone Ryloth-12 of the solar flares. The photographs were taken three days before the devastating CME.</p><br><p>Image captured from Cam-10 moments before the catastrophic solar flare decimates the surface of Megaflora.</p><br><p>On date 5/1/2021, footage from surveillance drone satellites 'Tauri-5', 'Vega-7' and 'Ryloth-12' displayed abnormally powerful solar flares erupting on the surface of the Sun. This appeared to coincide with the 'explosion' event at the end of the final transmission. As flares are a common occurrence in ordinary stars, the significance of the event was not recognized until eight days later, when a devastating coronal mass ejection (CME) slammed into Megaflora\u2019s surface, obliterating almost all surveillance equipment and instantly killing all personnel within the level.</p><br><p>Researchers speculate that the entity\u2019s intense aggravation towards the end of the final transmission induced increased magnetic activity within the interior of the star. This exerted unnatural stress on tangled solar arcades, precipitating magnetic reconnection and releasing the observed solar flares.</p><br><p>Alongside the solar flares, powerful CMEs were also produced \u2014 ejections of massive quantities of radioactive particles and electromagnetic energy into the Void \u2014 one of which collided directly into Megaflora. Though the tree is able to withstand Sigma radiation, it is not impervious to all electromagnetic emissions. The tree\u2019s unusually low atmosphere (averaging ~200m or 650 feet from its surface) provides minimal atmospheric shielding, leaving its surface vulnerable to bombardment by cosmic radiation. As a result, the solar ejecta effectively enveloped one face of the tree\u2019s surface, causing widespread devastation across its exterior comparable to the simultaneous detonation of several hundred thermonuclear bombs.</p><br><p>Two months prior to the solar flare event, permanent M.E.G. research outpost \"Biosphere\" had been completed on Megaflora, housing a total of 72 M.E.G. and B.P.C. personnel. The incoming CME was detected only ten minutes before impact, and evacuation of outpost Biosphere commenced immediately.</p><br><p>However, less than two minutes after evacuation orders, 58 of the 72 deployed personnel found themselves instantaneously and involuntarily transported into Level 4 without explanation. It is not known what \u2014 or who \u2014 rescued these personnel from the impending calamity.</p><br><p>All of the remaining 14 personnel within Megaflora occupied high-profile research and leadership positions within the M.E.G., and included all members of \u03a3-257's Supervising committee (apart from Auxiliary Researcher Sada). Of these 14 personnel, none are known to have survived.</p><br><p>Following months of search efforts, only one of the fourteen bodies was recovered. Much of the remains were severely irradiated and charred beyond recognition, requiring DNA analysis for identification. Autopsies indicated that the victim suffered fourth-degree burns which would have resulted in instant death, with a minimum absorbed radiation dose of around 10,000\u00a0Gy. Missing personnel likely received even larger doses, and were possibly vaporized by heat or exposure to Sigma radiation.</p><br><p>The defunct Project \u03a3-257 has been known for its exceptionally high casualty rate. Apart from the major incidents documented above, countless personnel were lost to local wildlife, accidental exposure to Sigma radiation, and other factors.</p><br><p>The following list remembers not only the 14 personnel who died in the Solar Flare Event, but all those who lost their lives in the \u03a3-257 Project.</p><br><p><strong><tt>In honor of your sacrifice for the sake of courageous exploration,</tt><br/>\n<tt>scientific research, and, above all, the betterment of humanity.</tt></strong></p><br><p>James \"Jim\" Seeley<br/>\nAndrew D.

Research Outpost Biosphere. Invaluable B.P.C. research documents on Megaflorean wildlife and extremely expensive M.E.G. drone satellite prototypes contained within were lost.</p><br><p>Much of the research supplies in Outpost Biosphere were obtained with difficulty from locations such as Level 3.1 and Level 420, and included state-of-the-art scientific instruments. The total financial loss is estimated at approximately 20 million BSC.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-9\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-9')\">9</a></sup></p><br><p>Although none of the surveillance cameras survived the event, several remote drone satellites had been launched into the Void, following the success of Arcturus-3. Many remain functional within the Level and are still in service, continually monitoring the entity for further solar activity.</p><br><p>Despite the extent of destruction sustained, the level\u2019s ecosystem regenerated astoundingly quickly after the event. As little as 10 hours following the CME, retrieval teams noted that flora was beginning to regrow. Fauna such as deer, squirrels and boars were also observed, though it is not known how they managed to survive.</p><br><p>Approximately nine days after initial flare observation, an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) radiated across the surface of Level 11, causing the temporary failure of electronic systems within M.E.G. Base Beta. The origin of the EMP could not be determined, and it is not known if the occurrence is correlated with the solar flare.</p><br><p>With respect to the Sun itself, findings suggest that the entity has entered a \"dormant\" state following the flare emissions. Footage from surviving drones indicates that the entity seemed to have shrunk extranormally following the loss of coronal mass. Quantities of measurable radiation (i.e. excluding sigma radiation) have permanently dipped since initial flare observation.</p><br><p>It is not known how long the Sun will remain in this state. Regardless, the M.E.G. will conduct no further research into the Sun Over the Void.</p><br><p>Date: 6/10/2021</p><br><p>This is Auxiliary Researcher Sada. Following Oversight Council discussion, and as the last surviving member of the Project's Supervising committee, I hereby announce the IMMEDIATE TERMINATION OF PROJECT \u03a3-257. Furthermore, until further notice is given, the M.E.G. <strong>strictly prohibits</strong> all manned exploration of Level Megaflora.</p><br><p>On behalf of leadership, I would like to apologize for the outcome of this Project. I am fully aware that under certain members of the Supervising committee (who are no longer with us), working conditions were\u2026 suboptimal. I have spoken to the Oversight Council, and they have agreed to discuss measures to prevent such negligence from occurring again.</p><br><p>Despite the circumstances, I am well aware of the breakthroughs with many of our findings. I <em>know</em> there\u2019s been a lot of work going into this, and that some of us may be disappointed at the Project's termination. But looking at the casualty count, we simply cannot in good conscience let this continue. We\u2019ve all seen what that <em>thing</em> is capable of.</p><br><p>Some things just aren't meant for us to know.

    "title": "- \"Volares\"",
    "description": "<p>Volares are small sharks that are typically airborne. They are notably hostile, despite their collective inability to pose any serious threat. These animals are highly intelligent, fast, and known company to the Captain's Crew. They seem to have complex social circles, which include bonds with non-volares that the entities might take a liking to.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup></p><br><p>Volares have a multitude of strange behavioral differences not seen in earthly sharks. These consist of the following:</p><br><p><em>Volares possess a level of sentience comparable to humans. They're capable of general reason. The overall hostility that most volares express is deemed to not be of anomalous origin and it is determined to not be an \"inherent\" part of their nature, nor should it discount their levels of sentience.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')\">3</a></sup></em></p><br><p><em>While volares have been shown to not have any evolutionary changes to allow them to speak, such as the addition of a tongue, they manage to produce noise in a manner that can form human words. This noise does not come from their mouths, instead seeming to project from the sharks individually. No serious analysis has been done of a volare's internal organs, but common theorization chalks this ability up to a sort of \"voice box\" within the animals. Note that this is simply theorization\u2014it is extremely difficult to locate a deceased volare for analysis purposes due to the social practices of volares. Further, while they can speak and can learn with great ease, to begin to learn and understand a language, volares must be in areas where this language is at least semi-regularly used. The best example of this are the volares accompanying the Captain's Crew, whom have been reported to speak fluent English, Portuguese, Italian, Spanish, among others. Due to the heightened intelligence of the creatures, picking up on languages takes much less time than it would the average person.</em></p><br><p><em>Volares possess the incredibly puzzling ability to fly. They do not seem to do so in a manner even remotely similar to birds. The demeanor of the creatures, while flying, seems as if they are simply swimming through the air. Consultation with certain Crew members, those who have taken any small amount of chemistry classes, in particular, has led the main researcher behind this article to believe that the sharks evolved to produce a substance effectively similar in nature to a human's skin oil. This oil, when analyzed, showed signs of being a compound that actively repels air molecules, allowing volares to move through air as if it were water. The specifics of this cannot be tested properly, due to limitations in the Crew's more science-inclined gatherings, but samples of the oil have been taken where possible for future research. As of now, the oil does not fully explain how the volare's body weight is not factored into its flight capabilities, but it offers a guiding concept for further research.</em></p><br><p><em>Volares are well known for stealing any large variety of items, similar to Sark Crabs and the Captain's Crew. While the sharks affiliated with the Crew largely only target well-off groups, such as the BNTG, others may snatch items directly from the hands of a wanderer. Ensure all personal belongings are kept secure and/or hidden when near volares. This behavior is likely inspired by their tendency to prefer scavenging to hunting.</em></p><br><p>The specific biology of a volare is assumed to be similar to that of a real-world nurse shark. Due to the complex social practices in volare communities, access to a volare corpse for proper analysis is incredibly difficult and discussions are still taking place for the Crew to have access to one. Currently, this seems to be an uphill battle, but hopes are still high in the name of science.</p><br><p>From what is known, volares tend to be two-toned\u2014the upper half of the shark is brownish, close to a sand-like color and the lower half is an incredibly light blue. volares are constantly slick, covered in the \"skin oil\" previously mentioned, which presumably keeps them hydrated outside of its purpose for aiding in their ability to fly. Additionally, the skin oil's ability to repel air molecules cause for volares to be incredibly fast in water, given the near-complete avoidance of any kind of friction within it.</p><br><p>Volares, in terms of shape and size, carry over the aforementioned similarities: they are flat sharks with rounded, broad heads. They typically weigh 90 to 150 kilograms and are usually recorded to be between 210 to 240 centimeters.</p><br><p>Due to the small nature of the animal and the smaller size of its mouth, when hunting it must focus its attention to either scavenging or targeting large amounts of much smaller prey. Their size and skillset make them an extremely minimal danger to other larger creatures, including people. Despite their tendency towards aggression, the animals are nearly physically incapable of causing any physical harm outside of bruises or scrapes.</p><br><p>Other differences from typical shark anatomy targets the mouth and gills. Rather than relying solely on gills, both the mouth and gills function to pull oxygen into the body and filter out unwanted parts of the oxygen. When outside of water, the gills shut entirely to defend it from being a potential point of weakness. Again, due to lack of ability to properly analyze the internal organs of a volare, the size, appearance, and placement of the lungs is purely hypothetical. Current hypothesis suggests that stomach size was sacrificed for the formation of these lungs.</p><br><p>Rumors around the Captain's Crew state that The Captain himself was the first individual to interact with a volare. This rumor is likely true, given he was the first known resident on Level 436, but it's to be noted that he made no effort to properly record the existence of volares. The first formally recorded discovery was by the second-ever crew member, Rue Achyls<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-4\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')\">4</a></sup>. Full biological sketches were made by the First Mate in the interest of recording their existence on 25/2/1994, but these have not yet been made available to the public eye as per the author's requests.</p><br><p><strong>EDIT: As of 27/3/2006, recording of (likely) prior discovery surfaced. See the attached addendum file.</strong></p><br><p><span style=\"font-family: Just Me Again Down Here; font-size: 150%;\"><em>March 27<sup>th</sup>, 1936</em></span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-family: Just Me Again Down Here; font-size: 150%;\">Ah! I've fallen behind on me Captain's logs. No good. 'Side from that, I believe it's me birthday! It's <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">incredible</span> <em>incredibly</em> difficult to keep track of how the years have passed, so I'm not sure if that year is accurate, and I'm not sure how old I am, but there be others in here, people from the future years, that tell me it sounds about right. It's strange to be in a place where there's next to nobody from your time period 'round. I've heard most like me went to some other group, somethin' called the \"Lost\", but I don't figure myself to be \"lost\". It's also strange to me that it seems piratin' has not survived in the ways I and others may have hoped. Not many I've come across have any boatin' experience. Sad.</span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-family: Just Me Again Down Here; font-size: 150%;\">Aside from that, me birthday has presented me with a wonderful gift: A new place! Somethin' more similar to what I was accustomed to\u2014a beach! It seems nowhere near as horrible as all of the other places here. I think I'd like to settle down here, maybe start up a group of my own. I don't want to <em>replace</em> me old crew, but I would like to have company again. I do hope me old crew was able to find a new Captain\u2026</span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-family: Just Me Again Down Here; font-size: 150%;\">Ah, nevermind that. I've got some form of company here. Thar be sharks that speak. And fly, but, well\u2026 I think I've stumbled across stranger in this place. One of 'em seems to have taken a likin' to me. The speakin' bit's a bit rough\u2014I know I said they speak, but it's mostly repeatin' me own words. I think they're still learnin', so I can't blame 'em. I'll just have to help 'em out, aye?</span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-family: Just Me Again Down Here; font-size: 150%;\">I think I'll name me new shark matey \"Bucket\". It seems to like 'em, with how it plays around with 'em. Likes to carry things, too, so that name sounds \"about right\", like those folks from the later years said.</span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-family: Just Me Again Down Here; font-size: 150%;\">I think I'll be takin' the rest of today to talk with Bucket, learn things 'bout it. It's an interestin' little feller! That's all for me logs today!</span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-family: Just Me Again Down Here; font-size: 150%;\"><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span> \u2014 The Captain</span></p><br><p>stream primus - <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/captaiin\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7044984); return false;\"><img alt=\"captaiin\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7044984&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334097\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7044984)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/captaiin\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7044984); return false;\">captaiin</a></span></p><br><p>image attribution!<br/>\nsource: <a href=\"https://openverse.org/image/d6fd85d3-052b-490b-8181-ff2206357182?q=nurse%20shark\">\"nurse sharks\"</a><br/>\ncreator: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/84108876@N00\">jason pratt</a><br/>\nlicense: <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/?ref=openverse\">cc by 2.0</a></p><br><p>\u00ab <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/entity-282\">Entity 282</a> | Entity 283 | <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/entity-284\">Entity 284</a> \u00bb</p><br>",

    "description": "<p>A theorized sketch of the Dark Sovereign drawn by a wanderer</p><br><p>The Dark Sovereign is an entity native to Zone 4 of Level 197. The entity has a largely unknown appearance, being <span style=\"color: red\">[ERR404:DATA_NOT_FOUND]</span> and comprised mostly of smoke. Two orbs follow the Sovereign, which are presumed to be its eyes, and an item appears to hang above its head, which to the few who have seen it, appears to be a crown-like object, signifying royalty or power.</p><br><p><tt>The surrounding environment begins to grow dark; cold, and lonely. Take a look around. Where are your friends? Did you ever have any? Where are you exactly? Do you really know? Are you in Level 4? 11? Maybe the Hub? Can you really tell? How do you know that in one second it won't all go to black?</tt></p><br><p>The Sovereign operates off of what some wanderers have called a \"respect basis,\" which entails that The Sovereign will reciprocate respect it is given. The few who respected the Sovereign escaped Zone 4 with their lives, but said that their exploration parties were not so lucky. Wanderers taken by the Sovereign have not been seen since their exploration into Zone 4.</p><br><p><tt>They entered his domain. They disrespected everything he worked hard to create. Making a place in reality for yourself is no easy feat. It was saddening to see how they were scared of him. They ran and he tried to comfort them\u2026 but all he touches screams in agony.</tt></p><br><p><tt>His behavior? It is somber\u2026 Calm. Melancholy is perhaps is the best term. It is so cold here, so dark; he created it, so he should not be ashamed of what he worked so hard to perfect. Where have the others gone? They disrespected him, so we helped them on their way out. You may recognize a few of your \"wanderers\" with some\u2026 changes. Look for the black scars and you will see. You will all see.</tt></p><br><p>The Dark Sovereign is a <span style=\"color: red\">[ERR404:DATA_NOT_FOUND]</span> and its body cannot be solidified. It is said to hold a weapon of sorts, which has been described <span style=\"color: red\">[ERR403:FORBIDDEN].</span></p><br><p><tt>You discovered him by pure luck. He thought he patched all of the holes and entry points to get in, but it looks like he was wrong. It happens, at points. We are all wrong, eventually. The first person to find him was named Anna. She was a sweet woman, and when she kneeled he knew he could not harm her; she quickly left when we told her that the exit was behind her</tt></p><br><p><span style=\"color: red\">[ERR404:DATA_NOT_FOUND]</span></p><br><p><tt>The next person was named Charles. He was a very rude man. We all agreed to get rid of him as soon as possible, along with his entire exploration party.<br/>\nThere was one man, though, named Mark. He submitted, and while he kneeled, scared for his life, we let him run qui-</tt></p><br><p><tt>Oh? We apologize, sire. We will not talk further.</tt></p><br><p>What? That's weird. I thought this file was saved with its information intact. Let's try reloading it\u2026</p><br><p><span style=\"color: darkgreen\">/reload file_entity-297</span></p><br><p><span style=\"color: red\">[ERR500:INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR]</span></p><br><p>Alright, what's going on here?
