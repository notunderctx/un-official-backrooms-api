    "description": "<p>2 thermoses of Almond Water found in a box on <a href=\"/level-3\">Level 3</a>.</p><br><p><strong>Object 1,</strong> better known as Almond Water, is a very useful object that can be obtained on most levels of the Backrooms. It is a set of metal thermoses filled with clear liquid. They are usually found individually across many levels, but sometimes they can be found in groups on levels where they are more abundant. It is unknown exactly how Almond Water became so abundant, but various ancient texts from <a href=\"/the-lost\">The Lost</a> suggest that all of the bottles may have suddenly appeared one day through unknown means, though it is always possible that these are just tales and not fact.</p><br><p>Most of the bottles are usually slightly damaged or worn with marks, such as dents or scratches in the paint. All of the thermoses are roughly 1\u2019 tall, and they are always filled to the very brim of the bottle, with each bottle being able to hold anywhere between 2\u20134 cups of water. If a bottle that is not full is found, do not consume the contents inside, as this usually means it was used by another wanderer who could have tampered with the contents inside or spread something such as <a href=\"/entity-17\">The Crawler Fungus</a>.</p><br><p>A picture of the clear liquid inside of a half-drinken bottle.</p><br><p>The contents of the bottle inside vary somewhat in taste, though all resemble water in both texture and appearance. Almond Water, granted that it has not been tampered with, is safe to consume by default; however, certain levels can have an anomalous effect that makes the liquid cause symptoms similar to cyanide poisoning to the drinker. There is no consistency in which levels cause this and which don\u2019t, nor any known way to find out beforehand \u2014 in the case that this effect applies, it will be listed on the level page. This effect can be neutralized by boiling the Almond Water; using a small pinch of <a href=\"/object-15\">Firesalt</a> can instantly boil the liquid to kill any bacteria inside, though it is worth noting that this method of boiling can cause the liquid to become slightly spicy if used too excessively.</p><br><p>As mentioned previously, there is also the possibility that other groups, individuals, and/or entities have tampered with the liquid. The general rule of thumb is this: \u201cWhen in doubt, boil the water.\u201d If one has the ability to do so, it is generally recommended to boil anyway before drinking as a precaution, unless it is an emergency situation.</p><br><p>A bottle of Almond Water inside the grass on <a href=\"/level-10\">Level 10</a>.</p><br><p>Almond Water is most commonly used by wanderers as an efficient source of nutrition. Drinking one whole bottle of Almond Water provides the same nutritional value as a healthy, 600-calorie meal, meaning that three bottles a day will provide sufficient daily nutrition for the average, healthy person. Despite being the first object ever discovered by <a href=\"/the-m-e-g\">The M.E.G.</a>, it is still unknown exactly how this is possible. Due to its abundance across most levels, Almond Water is a very easy way to obtain sustenance and maintain physical health. It also prevents the need for any form of husbandry, creating a better sense of efficiency in more settled levels such as <a href=\"/level-11\">Level 11</a>. Aside from calories, the water also provides necessary vitamins and nutrients such as protein, sodium, and fat.</p><br><p>Despite traces of things like sugar and sodium being found within the liquid, this does not appear to alter the flavor or taste as it would be expected to. For example, not all of the variants of Almond Water are salty despite having equal amounts of sodium across all variants. Additionally, methods that would usually separate things like salt and sugar from the liquid \u2014 such as boiling \u2014 have been fruitless, and no residual substances have been acquired, as would be expected with a water mixture. This has lead some suspicious researchers to believe that the liquid is not water, rather a natural, anomalous substance that resembles it. Much of this has yet to be confirmed. Below is a nutrition label for 1 bottle of Almond Water, courtesy of <a href=\"/b-n-t-g\">The B.N.T.G.</a></p><br><p>A more damaged bottle of Almond Water.</p><br><p>Almond Water is generally the most popular item used in bartering as well. Since a standardized currency across multiple levels is generally impossible, many wanderers resort to bartering, thus leading to the object having some economical value. Almond Water is one of the most commonly traded items in places such as <a href=\"/level-5-1\">Level 5.1</a> and <a href=\"/traders-vault\">The Trader\u2019s Vault</a>; the object is usually used similarly to a single standardized unit of currency, such as 1 dollar, euro, or pound. Many groups of interest and communities value objects offered in bartering in comparison to Almond Water. It is recommended that wanderers carry a sizable quantity of Almond Water on heavily settled levels such as Level 11 or <a href=\"/level-6-1\">Level 6.1</a> due to it being the most generally preferred standardization of trade value.</p><br><p>Individually, many wanderers also prefer to use Almond Water for its recreational purposes that it can provide. Almond Water thermoses can be found in various different colored bottles, all of which have their own unique taste and effect. Many wanderers cite their enjoyment of them due to the general familiarity that they provide, being common in works such as the recipes in <a href=\"/object-56\">Object 56</a>. In juxtaposition to most powerful, anomalous, and more often than not dangerous objects that are common throughout The Backrooms, Almond Water usually provides effects that normal, every-day drinks would provide naturally. Various effects include temporary symptom relief, relaxation, sleep help, and other similar benefits, which are listed below.</p><br><p>The properties of Almond Water differ depending on the color of the bottle. Originally, it was presumed that the bottles had some sort of anomalous property attached to them, or that they acted more akin to a potion of sorts. After further studies were done, it was found that this was far from the case, and rather accomplished via small doses of natural substances that are dissolved into the liquid inside. Despite this, it is still unknown exactly how and why said auxiliary substances are in the drink to begin with and why they aren\u2019t scientifically extractable. Nevertheless, Almond Water is completely potable in all regular circumstances. Attached below are the documented variations of Almond Water.</p><br><p>Known types include:</p><br><p><span class=\"titlebox\">Grey</span></p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p><br><p><span class=\"titlebox\">Green</span></p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p><br><p><span class=\"titlebox\">Red</span></p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p><br><p><span class=\"titlebox\">Blue</span></p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p><br><p>Almond Water was the first object to be discovered by what would eventually become <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/m-e-g-team-overseer\">Team Overseer</a>. It was discovered on their first expedition of The Backrooms in late 2011 before The M.E.G. was established later-on. Attached below is a log of the discovery:</p><br><p><strong>Time:</strong> 2:07\u00a0pm<br/>\n<strong>Date:</strong> January 13th, 2012<br/>\n<strong>Location:</strong> <a href=\"/level-2\">Level 2</a><br/>\n<strong>Operatives involved:</strong> Team Overseer</p><br><p><em>[A loud sound of rushing fluid can be heard in the background as the mic switches on.]</em></p><br><p><strong>Overseer C:</strong> No way, guys! My cell phone\u2019s audio recorder just turned on!</p><br><p><strong>Overseer A:</strong> What? I thought our phones got fried when we entered.</p><br><p><strong>Overseer C:</strong> Me too, but I got it working after some piddling around with the stuff we found in <a href=\"/level-1\">the white brick place</a>!</p><br><p><strong>Overseer B:</strong> Since when were you the tech guy?</p><br><p><strong>Overseer C:</strong> I\u2019m not a tech guy, I just know how phones work. You guys are lucky I never caved and bought an iPhone; there\u2019s probably some software that blocks any component fiddling. Androids: 1, Apple: 0. <em>[Overseer C snickers in a snarky way]</em></p><br><p><strong>Overseer A:</strong> Whatever you say, dude. Is it fully functional, or did you just use the parts to make an audio recorder?</p><br><p><strong>Overseer C:</strong> It\u2019s \u00fcber busted inside, but functional enough that I was able to access the audio app. I\u2019m recording this in case we ever get out of here to prove we\u2019re not crazy to the cops.</p><br><p><strong>Overseer B:</strong> <em>[Laughs in the distance]</em></p><br><p><strong>Overseer A:</strong> Kat, don\u2019t have such a pessimistic attitude. We\u2019re gonna get out of here.</p><br><p><strong>Overseer B:</strong> Stretch, it\u2019s been weeks since we came in here. The only reason we\u2019re still alive is because Andrew thankfully had a few water bottles and granola bars in his backpack. I\u2019m starving, sleep-deprived, have almost died multiple times, and may not ever see my family again. The fact that you two are so happy-go-lucky disturbs me.</p><br><p><em>[There is silence for a few seconds]</em></p><br><p><strong>Overseer B:</strong> Look, I didn\u2019t mean to make you all upset, but one of us needs to be the realist around here. If we\u2019re not careful, we\u2019re going to get ripped apart by who knows what\u2019s out there. Heck, the only reason we\u2019re not still in the <a href=\"/level-0\">mono-yellow labyrinth</a> is because we randomly fell through the floor into lurking danger and then also accidentally ended up in th-this awful place. And you two are over there with this pipe dream that we\u2019re gonna live? <em>[She coughs]</em> I don\u2019t think you <em>[She coughs again]</em> you both understand- <em>[Overseer B begins to cough really loudly and collapses to the floor]</em></p><br><p><strong>Overseer A:</strong> Kat!</p><br><p><strong>Overseer B:</strong> I- <em>[Coughs]</em> I am fine\u2026 Just thirsty\u2026</p><br><p><strong>Overseer C:</strong> Are those hives on your arms?</p><br><p><strong>Overseer B:</strong> No! Just- <em>[Coughs]</em> bumps.</p><br><p><strong>Overseer A:</strong> We need to stop. You\u2019re clearly not okay.</p><br><p><strong>Overseer B:</strong> No! We\u2019re gonna- <em>[Kat coughs violently before throwing up blood]</em>.</p><br><p><strong>Overseer C:</strong> What in the\u2026</p><br><p><strong>Overseer A:</strong> HELP! WE NEED HELP!</p><br><p><strong>Overseer B:</strong> Shut up, you idiot- <em>[Kat throws up once again]</em>.</p><br><p><strong>Overseer A:</strong> There has to be someone here who can help. There just has to be!</p><br><p><strong>Overseer B:</strong> No\u2026 Leave me.</p><br><p><strong>Overseer A:</strong> What?!</p><br><p><strong>Overseer B:</strong> Whatever this is, it could spread to you. We\u2019re all gonna die anyway- <em>[Coughs]</em></p><br><p><strong>Overseer A:</strong> No. There\u2019s still hope. There always is. Andrew, pick her up. We can help her.</p><br><p><strong>Overseer C:</strong> Should I keep this thing rolling?</p><br><p><strong>Overseer A:</strong> No! Put it away!</p><br><p><em>[The device turns off]</em></p><br><p><strong>Overseer C:</strong> Hey. Somehow still not dead. Kat is barely able to talk. The hives are all over her body, and her eyes are bloodshot. Stretch made us makeshift masks out of the fabric of his jacket. We had to stop because I couldn\u2019t carry Kat anymore. It\u2019s been about 15 minutes, and we haven\u2019t found anyone. I think our streak of luck has come to an end.</p><br><p><strong>Overseer A:</strong> What are you doing?</p><br><p><strong>Overseer C:</strong> I don\u2019t know, man. Talking to this makes me feel better. Makes me feel like someone\u2019s listening.</p><br><p><strong>Overseer A:</strong> Suit yourself. You really can\u2019t carry her anymore?</p><br><p><strong>Overseer C:</strong> No, dude. None of us are athletes. Gosh, I should\u2019ve listened to my dad when he told me to join the football team.</p><br><p><strong>Overseer A:</strong> I\u2019m gonna go scout the nearby area. Watch Kat. Take my pepper spray and run like heck if anything comes.</p><br><p><strong>Overseer C:</strong> Got it. <em>[Overseer A leaves]</em></p><br><p><strong>Overseer B:</strong> (Hoarsely) Go with Stretch, and leave me, Andrew.</p><br><p><strong>Overseer C:</strong> No. We all leave together. We\u2019re 16, Kat. We shouldn\u2019t be talking about death and sacrifice. It will be okay.</p><br><p><em>[Overseer A can be heard suddenly gasping in the background]</em></p><br><p><strong>Overseer C:</strong> Stretch! What is it?</p><br><p><strong>Overseer A:</strong> Look! Our saving grace!</p><br><p><strong>Overseer C:</strong> Is\u2026 that a red thermos?</p><br><p><strong>Overseer A:</strong> Look what\u2019s inside! Water!</p><br><p><strong>Overseer C:</strong> You\u2019ve got to be kidding. There was just a full bottle of water sitting there? Yeah, right. Is there a name or anything on it?</p><br><p><strong>Overseer A:</strong> No, it\u2019s fine!</p><br><p><strong>Overseer C:</strong> Are you sure it\u2019s safe? It smells\u2026 odd. Like\u2026 almonds.</p><br><p><strong>Overseer A:</strong> Who cares?! Kat is dying! She needs water! Pour it in her mouth!</p><br><p><strong>Overseer C:</strong> I don\u2019t know. This seems too good to be true, but it <em>is</em> an emergency. Open wide, Kat.</p><br><p><em>[Kat can be heard guzzling the water for a few seconds]</em></p><br><p><strong>Overseer B:</strong> <em>[Kat coughs and struggles to swallow the water]</em> What\u2026 is this? It tastes horrible\u2026</p><br><p><strong>Overseer C:</strong> <em>[Sips the beverage]</em> Ew! It\u2019s tastes like that nasty medicine we\u2019d get as kids. <em>[Sips some more]</em></p><br><p><strong>Overseer A:</strong> Let me try i- OH MY- ANDREW!</p><br><p><em>[A loud roar can be heard from the distance. Kat and Andrew start screaming. Andrew spits out the water in shock. The creature begins to scream in agony and gurgle before gyrating on the floor violently.]</em></p><br><p><strong>Overseer A:</strong> It\u2019s the water! Kill it!</p><br><p><em>[Andrew splashes more water on the creature, causing it to roar even louder in more pain.]</em></p><br><p><strong>Overseer C:</strong> Where\u2019s that knife you found in the white brick hallway?!</p><br><p><strong>Overseer A:</strong> Here! Take it!</p><br><p><em>[Overseer C stabs the creature in the neck, causing it to let out one last roar before dying. There is a moment of silence as they process what happened.]</em></p><br><p><strong>Overseer B:</strong> What\u2026 did you two\u2026 give me?</p><br><p><strong>Overseer C:</strong> I\u2026 thought it was just water.</p><br><p><em>[The device suddenly turns off]</em></p><br><p><strong>Result:</strong> After the events of this log, Overseer B healed back to proper health in about a week. It was later discovered that she had contracted <a href=\"/entity-19\">Entity 19</a> during their exploration of Level 2. She has been symptom-free ever since. The group eventually traveled to <a href=\"/level-3\">Level 3</a> and discovered a plethora of bottles there, which helped them survive the rest of their journey. The entity was later identified as a Skin-Stealer when the log was officially archived after the creation of the database. Almond Water was awarded Object 1 due to its critical importance in the survival of Team Overseer, and eventually most \u2014 if not all \u2014 wanderers in The Backrooms.</p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong>Authors</strong></span></p><br><p><strong>This page is under ownership of the Backrooms Wiki Staff team.</strong></p><br><p>The original author of this entry is <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/1000dumplings\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(2864629); return false;\"><img alt=\"1000dumplings\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=2864629&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1731170070\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=2864629)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/1000dumplings\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(2864629); return false;\">1000dumplings</a></span></p><br><p>The component on the top of the page is by <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/theantarctic\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6575845); return false;\"><img alt=\"TheAntarctic\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=6575845&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1731170070\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=6575845)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/theantarctic\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6575845); return false;\">TheAntarctic</a></span></p><br><p>Rewritten by <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/natedagreat563\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7243253); return false;\"><img alt=\"Natedagreat563\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7243253&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1731170070\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7243253)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/natedagreat563\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7243253); return false;\">Natedagreat563</a></span> and <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/poliacci\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7863813); return false;\"><img alt=\"Poliacci\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7863813&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1731170070\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7863813)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/poliacci\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7863813); return false;\">Poliacci</a></span><br/>\n<a href=\"/natedagreatap\">Nate\u2019s Author Page</a></p><br><p><strong>Nate\u2019s other pages:</strong></p><br><p>Object 1 | <a href=\"/object-2\">Object 2</a> \u00bb</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/object-1\">Object 1</a>\" by Natedagreat563, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

    "description": "<p><strong>Level Keys</strong> are rare objects found across the Backrooms. Every level has its own key and there can be multiple keys 'belonging' to one level. Most <strong>Level Keys</strong> bear a resemblance to 20th century cast-iron keys; however, they also contain a unique identifier as to their home level. They can unlock doors within these levels and can also be used to access their home level through doors in other levels. <strong>Level Keys</strong> function identically to <a href=\"/the-frontrooms\">Frontrooms</a> keys, with a few quirks. Much of the inner workings of these strange keys is unknown, and are still undergoing active research by <a href=\"/the-m-e-g\">the M.E.G.</a></p><br><p>Interestingly, the most useful property of Level Keys is that they all resonate specific frequencies depending on how many Levels you must travel through in order to arrive at its 'home' level. It is always the shortest route. Frequencies for each distance are seemingly random for each key type; however, it has been theorised that if one could crack the 'prediction code' for a type of level key, one could predict distance based on frequency or vice versa for that key type. Datasets for level navigation far from the Quantum Stable levels are quite valuable and often sought after by expert explorers and wanderers. The M.E.G. has recently discovered that keys from the Frontrooms vibrate incredibly faintly, hinting at some sort of exit. If one could crack the prediction code for the Frontroom keys, we could get a 'hot or cold' detector that directs us towards the Frontrooms. This property is currently undergoing extensive research.</p><br><p><strong>Level Keys</strong> used for LPSs (Level Positioning System) are broken down into shards for more compact storage and to maximise the amount of LPSs produced per <strong>Level Key</strong>. However, these shards are unable to open doors.</p><br><p>Small booklets are used in order to triangulate what level you are in. Here is an example from a basic dataset for the first twenty levels on how to utilise <strong>Level Keys</strong> to find your level location. A dataset is named based on the amount of keys it supports and the corresponding levels. For example a dataset named 5kLPS 0-10-20-30-40-50 means it supports up to five <strong>Level Key</strong> shards from Level 0, 10, etc\u2026</p><br><p>Within the collapsible below is a step-by-step tutorial/scenario on how to effectively use a basic 3kLPS 0-10-20 to find your current level.</p><br><p>A mockup of a written dataset. Only contains a small portion and is NOT accurate to true datasets.</p><br><p>The triangulation keys in this scenario (keys used as a base to find your level) are from Level 0, 10 and 20. These are arbitrary choices, but they serve well. Assume we are in Level 7; however, we are unaware of this and want to locate our level. We pull out our frequency meter and remove the three <strong>Level Key</strong> shards from their special case. We start to measure these shards while consulting our dataset within a booklet.</p><br><p><strong>The Level 0 Key is resonating at 538hz. According to the Level 0 frequency list this is a distance of 4 from Level 0.<br/>\nThe Level 10 Key is resonating at 367hz. According to the Level 10 frequency list this is a distance of 5 from Level 10.<br/>\nThe Level 20 Key is resonating at 234hz. According to the Level 20 frequency list this is a distance of 2 from Level 20.</strong></p><br><p>Next, consult your booklet on the distance list:<br/>\n<strong>Possible levels for a distance of 4 from Level 0 are: 0, 7, 8<br/>\nPossible levels for a distance of 5 from Level 10 are: 7, 9, 17<br/>\nPossible levels for a distance of 2 from Level 20 are: 11, 7</strong></p><br><p>As you can see, Level 7 is present in all of these, therefore it is a safe bet to assume that your current level is Level 7. Keep in mind the frequency and distance lists used here are random and <em>not accurate</em>.</p><br><p>When held whilst asleep, <strong>Level Keys</strong> can occasionally induce strange dreams about many different levels, often random. It is assumed this is how <a href=\"/object-99\">{ACCESS DENIED}</a> functions.</p><br><p><strong>Level Keys</strong> are only found in their respective levels and are often hidden or hard to find, especially in large or infinite levels.

    "title": "Object 3 - \"Smiler Repellent\" In revision, please wait for this file to update",
    "description": "<p><strong>Smiler Repellent</strong> is an extremely rare liquid used to help repel the affects of <a href=\"/entity-3\">Smilers</a>. Its methods, ingredients, and overall reason for existence is largely unknown. However, due to its unique effects at targeting one of the most dangerous Entities within The Backrooms, it is currently being harvested at all cost. Efforts into this field have resulted largely negligent, due to our primary team being incapable of acquiring <strong>Smiler Repellent</strong> efficiently. Because of this, agreements have been formed with <a href=\"/the-lost\">The Lost</a> in order to help acquire this liquid.</p><br><p><strong>Smiler Repellent</strong> itself is a largely transparent liquid not to dissimilar to <a href=\"/object-1\">Almond Water</a>. The composition of the liquid is near impossible to find, and is largely based upon a mixture of Almond Water alongside a few other unknown ingredients. Current efforts with The Lost are being done in order to attempt to find out what ingredients make up the exact composition of <strong>Smiler Repellent.</strong></p><br><p>The specific effects of <strong>Smiler Repellent</strong> revolve largely around how much of the liquid you actually have to use. A small drop of it has been noted to clear the area of Smilers within 20 meters, though the exact measurements vary. Smilers struck with any effects of <strong>Smiler Repellent</strong> have been noted to appear weaker for extended periods of time. The greatest effect of <strong>Smiler Repellent</strong> comes from the way it responds to direct contact with Smilers. Should <strong>Smiler Repellent</strong> come into direct contact with any Smiler, the Smiler will inadvertently disappear from sight, and have never been noted to return to the wanderer.</p><br><p><span style=\"color: blue\">Following Event A, alongside the proper interpretation of Rune A - EPE-500-SRH, all capabilities and functions of <strong>Smiler Repellent</strong> have gone stagnant, with no indication of returning. <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">The reasoning for this is largely unknown</span> Following the discovery of additional documentation, The reasoning may be uncovered (see Addenda 2). Currently, the exact method of making <strong>Smiler Repellent</strong> is understood, and all information can be found below (See Rune A - EPE-500-SRH).</span></p><br><p>Correspondence received from Lost Legion, 7/04/2009:</p><br><p>Greetings Vera. No, we cannot tell you exactly why we know your name; however, we reach out to you urgently. Recent efforts on Level 500 have proven most fruitful, as we have discovered a previously unknown section of the Level, most known for being a waterscape. This waterscape appears to stretch out infinitely, occasionally lined with rocks. However, one notable discovery was made. When you first encounter this waterscape, a very specific rock aurates a high amount of runic energy.</p><br><p>The waterscape itself is fine to traverse, so long as you avoid the water. Currently, many large creatures can be seen lurking throughout the water, some of which can be seen way off in the distance, stretching out as far as the eye can see. These instances have been marked to snap beyond standard reaches, taking anything which dares goes near the water, even looking to it from above. However, the rune of interest appears to be stemming from the water itself.</p><br><p>This rune seems like something you may be interested in. Recent conflicts with The Splinter means we are unable to tell you exactly what actually may interest you; however, we would be more than willing to rendezvous on <a href=\"/level-628\">Level 628</a> to discuss these advances. If you wish to meet us, simply go to The Desert and wait. We will find you if you are there, you need not wait more than 5 minutes. Any time within the next month will do. Thank you.</p><br><p>Recent efforts involving The Lost have resulted in the discovery of a Rune directly pertaining to <strong>Smiler Repellent</strong>, more specifically, how to create it. This rune was discovered on Level 500 following recent allegiances created between Rune Recovery - Team \"Vera\" and The Lost Legions. The following log describes the initial exchange between Team \"Vera\" captain Vera Trixie and the anonymous member of The Lost.</p><br><p><em>Communication Log begin Time: 2:34 P.M.</em></p><br><p><em>Engaging Conversers: Vera Trixie, Lost Legions member (unknown)</em></p><br><p><em>Location: Unidentified section within Level 628 (The Desert).</em></p><br><p><em>Communication Log Summary: The following communication Log was done after The Lost Legions member reached out to Vera discreetly through letter, and describes the interaction they had about proceeding to discover EPE-500-SRH.</em></p><br><p><em>Note: Log was begun when Lost Legions member was seen within the distance of The Desert.</em></p><br><p><strong>&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;</strong></p><br><p><em>Within the distance, a pair of feet can be heard very faintly, only discernible by the wind.

We will be meeting on Level 178 tomorrow early morning, bringing standard rune excursion supplies. Due to the mysterious nature of The Lost, alongside being unaware of their full capabilities, we have elected not to record any conversation with The Lost.</em></p><br><p>The following summary was written up by Vera Trixie as a brief summary of the events which occurred on Level 500.</p><br><p>To begin, we entered Level 178. At first, we chose to avoid making any unnecessary movement, as we were unsure if we were supposed to. After waiting for around 45 minutes, we began wandering in random directions, eventually ending up within the kitchen area of the Level, where we chose to rest. After this moment, a figure was visible within the distance.<br/>\nOnce the figures were confirmed to be approaching our direction, we pulled out any weapons we had. The majority of the team had makeshift blunt weapons; only I had a proper weapon (a knife). However, the closer they got, the more I realized how similar they looked to the unidentified figure I saw previously. Reluctantly, I told my team to put down their weapons. They did so. After being approached by the members of The Lost, they made no noise or attempt to speak. Instead, they handed us blindfolds, and motioned towards their heads, conveying to us to put them on.<br/>\nAfter I explained to them that we felt uncomfortable doing that, they showed that they possessed no actual weapons, and told us that \"a team of two is more vulnerable than a team of 6.\" Following that logic, we hesitantly put on the blindfolds, due to both the trust with The Lost, as well as their general passiveness towards situations. Once we put them on, they immediately grabbed onto each of us and began an unexpected no-clip, startling a few; however, we were able to keep composure. After arriving at what we presumed to be Level 500, we were instructed to keep our blindfolds on.<br/>\nOnce we gathered our bearings, we were walked in seemingly random directions, oftentimes hearing distant chatter. After a presumed 30 minutes of walking, we were instructed that we were allowed to remove our blindfolds. When removed, we found ourselves at the aforementioned watered area. The surrounding land was largely empty, consisting of infinite stretches of beach. The water sat below us, and in the distance sat two rocks. One displayed no abnormal properties, the one in the distance. The closer one displayed very high Rune aura.<br/>\nLooking into the water, a striking amount of Entities immediately came into sight. Many leviathan-like species came into sight, but they all appeared to be harmless. However, a single speck of dirt blew off the solitary rock due to the wind caused by our team approaching the edge. 3 Entities jumped out of the water suddenly, then suddenly dazzled and turned into giant clouds. No one knew how they did this, but the speck of dirt disappeared from existence.<br/>\nAfter that happened, no one felt comfortable going near the water. However, the rune was right there, and we only needed a chiseled piece of it to analyze it completely. Getting that piece was as easy as getting to the island and kicking at it for a bit, you could see just by looking at it. However, we were unable to figure out how to get there. The waterbank was flooded with Entities. We were sure there was more underneath, awaiting there chance to feast on whatever came above. However, a single idea formed within my head.<br/>\nSuddenly, I took out my own sample of <strong>Smiler Repellent</strong>, fashioned within a bottle, and threw it out. The confusion from the Entities allowed one single moment of still, before they all jumped up at the same time. The bank was clear for a moment, before quite suddenly, every Entity which jumped up became various clouds. They all flew away in a pattern of spectacularism.</p><br><p>From there, the bank was clear for a bit. It wouldn't be long before it was full once more, so we were already beginning our approach. We didn't know if we could trust the water, but the water was giving off an aura of evil. After a while, we came up with a single method. Mena pulled out her rope and grabbed onto the rock. From there, Mena pulled the rock, causing many pieces of it to fall. However, she managed to get one single piece of the rock to latch on, and pulled it in immediately. A few Entities came; however, the pieces of the rock which slid down initially distracted them long enough to get the rock back.<br/>\nThe Lost then proceeded to take the rock for study, surprising many of us. They then pushed us down, and immediately, well fell back into <a href=\"/level-1\">Level 1</a>. However, Mena surprised us with a second, smaller rock, which also was chiseled. The size of the rock was small enough to be a pebble, but it worked! After that, we walked back to the main Rune base on Level 1, where we met up with Fortina and immediately gave her the rune.</p><br><p>The following Rune database entry was deciphered and sent by Fortina Sorens, head of Rune Decryption, alongside the arhivist team. The report sent is as follows.</p><br><p>Photograph of EPE-500-SRH, caught on Level 500</p><br><p>Piece of EPE-500-SRH, acquired by Mena Alinios.</p><br><p>EPE-500-SRH is a minor Rune directly related to Smilers and <strong>Smiler Repellent</strong>. The information present within the Rune itself largely appears to relate to the creation of <strong>Smiler Repellent</strong>. The message within the Rune is a poem related to Smilers and their Repellent, deciphered by Fortina Sorens. The following poem was deciphered within the Rune, though due to the size of the Rune, it may not be perfectly translated.</p><br><p>Liquid hatred and liquid love<br/>\nCombine to oppose the one hidden .<br/>\nCast away in a shadow, filled with hate<br/>\nNever again to be seen, killing all in its wake.</p><br><p>The interpretation of this Rune appears to relate to <strong>Smiler Repellent</strong>, more specifically, how to make it. \"Liquid Hatred\" and \"Liquid Love\" appear to be referring to <a href=\"/object-1\">Almond Water</a> and <a href=\"/object-44\">Cashew Water</a> respectively. Because of this, the two ingredients within <strong>Smiler Repellent</strong> are presumed to be Almond Water and Cashew Water. Test are being instituted to see whether or not these claims are fictitious or not.</p><br><p>Following the event of attempting to combine Cashew Water and Almond Water, a massive explosion was glimpsed for a brief moment. Despite this, no people conducting the experiment were hurt in any way, though could very clearly remember the explosion before passing out. All traces of both the Almond Water and Cashew Water have disappeared, and attempts to replicate these results have proven to not cause the same effect.</p><br><p><span style=\"color: blue\">When combined, they now create standard water. Significance of this is unknown, though it is presumed to be unimportant. All traces of <strong>Smiler Repellent</strong> have disappeared.

    "title": "Object 4 - \"Deuclidators\"",
    "description": "<p>Deuclidators, also known as Warplooms, are small, mechanical objects originally found in small supply crates on Level 5. Over the course of roughly a year, the <a href=\"/b-n-t-g\">B.N.T.G.</a> found a way to reverse-engineer them and is now producing them at a steady rate.</p><br><p>Outwardly, the Deuclidator is a rectangular machine, usually about 0.25 meters in length. It has no obvious screen interfaces or ports, but does contain a small input box, two dials, and one blue button. It has one large exposed wire around its handle and is usually grey in color.</p><br><p>Inwardly, the Deuclidator is a complex machine, with the top half of the box being taken up by several cogs of varying sizes and the bottom half a battery and about 300 loomlike strings, which hold the capacity to vibrate fast enough to cause the Deuclidator's strange effects. Its battery and input box take up about 40 percent of the internal capacity, the cogs and meshes around 30 percent, and the rest is occupied by the loom.</p><br><p>The Deuclidator has several properties considered unusual and anomalous. It can, of course, warp (or \"de-Euclid-ate\") surrounding areas, usually up to around 50 meters at maximum charge. The way this appears to the human eye is the surrounding area getting considerably closer without shrinking in size. In reality, the Deuclidator is vibrating one of its strings at the vibrational frequency of each kind of atom (and presumably other types of material), therefore generating immense gravitational force regardless of target materials. The input box has been a growing enigma, especially for the B.N.T.G., as they have had a growing obsession with decoding what exactly is a usable fuel. So far, the most efficient fuel discovered are rhinestones, with copper and rubber being close seconds. Paper is effective but highly inefficient. This is all greatly mysterious as the input box has no known means of consuming the fuel.<br/>\nDeuclidators are completely neutralized when in proximity of a <a href=\"/object-32\">reality freshener</a>.</p><br><p>The two dials on the Deuclidator's surface are used to set range and strength. The input box takes in any viable fuel, and the singular button activates and deactivates the machine. Deucidators are obviously useful for travel, considering their ability to cover rough terrain with ease, and fleeing or combat are also very possible with a Deuclidator. If used correctly, a Deuclidator can warp an opponent far into the air or under the ground. However, Deuclidators are heavily monitored in zones with high faction activity due to their powerful properties.</p><br><p>There are an estimated 350 Deuclidators in existence. At least 320 of these have been manufactured.</p><br><p>Note: Extremely common use of a Deuclidator can cause melancholy and nausea. Deuclidators are not recommended for use more than 20 times in a single day, or by those who suffer from seasickness.</p><br><p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Global date:</span></strong> 11/15/2020\u00a014:06:05</p><br><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">start log</span><br/>\n<strong>0:00:00:</strong> Unknown human approaches defensive wall of Trader's Keep.</p><br><p><strong>0:03:03:</strong> Unknown human produces a Deuclidator from their pocket.</p><br><p><strong>0:03:54:</strong> Unknown human attempts to use Deuclidator to warp through wall.

Life was good.</strong></p><br><p><strong>Come round October and a couple friends of mine started getting real bored, so we figured we'd take part in the Halloween celebrations. Now, I was never really the Halloweener type in my youth, but I figured this would be a good opportunity to have the fun I'd missed when I was a kid. You dig? So, I got on this crusty old overcoat, filled with holes, the type you'd see on bum or a drifter, and a grey, featureless mask so that I could dress up like a Duller. And I tricked and I treated frolicking to and fro with my friends, getting candy from the nice wanderers that resided in the level. It was a good time all around.</strong></p><br><p><strong>After that, me and my friends headed home. Drank a little liquor and began gouging ourselves on that night's earning, and that's how it started, you know? Like, you realize, \"hey this shit tastes pretty good\", and pretty soon you get addicted. And people say \"oh, I'm addicted to coffee\" or \"I'm addicted to junk food\", but you haven't really been an addict until you'll do anything to get another bit. You'll backstab your friends, even kill a man if you have to.</strong></p><br><p><strong>Luckily, the Eleven effect stopped me from going quite that far. I usually just kept to stealing. A little trick that me and some friends figured out is that if you pop a Stanley, you can walk into someone's house through the cracks in the wall, and then when it's time to escape, pop another one. It can be dangerous though too because if you're still in the crack, you get straight squished. Happened to a friend of mine, he popped a Stanley, and by the time he got out, the <a href=\"/the-eyes-of-argos\">Eyes</a> were waiting for him, so he just waited in a crack for them to pass on. I was his getaway man, you dig? And I wasn't on the Eyes' list yet, so I was able to wait there safely, and I saw it all go down. He was still waiting for the Eyes to go away when it wore off, and I don't think I'll ever get that sound out of my head. Not his screams, those got cut off pretty quickly, but the horrible squelching sound that his body made as his bones and organs were crushed in the crack.</strong></p><br><p><strong>Shit, I've done some bad stuff when I was doped up on candy. Just trying to scrounge together enough BNTG credit to score another bag. It was enough to get the Eyes on me for a while too. I got around them by hiding out int <a href=\"/traders-vault\">The Keep</a> for a couple years.</strong></p><br><p><strong>When I went to the keep, it was much easier than expected to find another plug. They seek out your need like a beacon. I saw him in the alley after I'd been there for not 15 minutes, spitting out a big glob of blood and puss, the tell of a Waster. I personally don't touch Waste. Some of the people I've met swear by it, but I just feel like my teeth are gonna fall out every time I use it. I'd have to be real deep to become a Waster, and if it ever comes to that, just take me out back. Anyway, I correctly figured if the fella was a Waster, he was probably also a dealer of some sort, or at the very least knew where to find one. What better way to fund a habit than by dealing?</strong></p><br><p><strong>My time in the Keep was probably one of my lowest points. I'd spend 8 hours a day just staring at the wall. Every once and a while I'd pop another Bullet and just bask in it. Didn't get a lot of visitors back then, after all I didn't know too many people in the Keep, and those who did come, I mostly just ignored, stuck in a dull haze until my supply got low. Then I'd hit up Sid the Scrivener to get me another bag.</strong></p><br><p><strong>This continued until I reached my last credit. Things are much harder to steal in the Keep, more eyes on you. Lowercase e, of course, the Eyes not catching me there was about the only good thing, but nevertheless, the human side of things was a lot harder to get around, what with the BNTG and all that. If they even are human. Anyway, when I ran out of credits, I figured it was time to head back to Eleven. I wasn't sure what I was going to do there, but it was better than getting in the negatives with big BNTG, that was certainly for sure.</strong></p><br><p><strong>At that point, I figured I'd go clean, and I did, on and off. Though that really only ever lasted until my next opportunity to relapse, so I just stuck to doing odd jobs here and there to pay for my habit. An article for the Eagle here. A job for the Meggies there, and that's about where I am. I wish I could quit. And I've heard rumors of people working on a way to get people off the stuff, but these efforts always get snuffed out. Nothings confirmed, but I know it's the BNTG who's keeping it from getting out. If people were able to get off Candy so easy, they'd lose money, and nothing ever mattered more to them than that.</strong></p><br><p><strong>See, at this point, I know the BNTG are still at the bottom of the whole Candy operation. After all, who else could keep the Candy supply moving than them? I figure they're just selling wholesale to a few trusted sources at the bottom and letting it trickle out to the common folk. Big BNTG publicly disavowed the stuff after it became public that it was addictive, but I think they knew the whole time. Those scumbags always were trying to get as much money as possible. I figure they made it addictive on purpose, or at the very least made a conscious decision to capitalize on it after they found out. Whatever the case is, they've certainly kept the Candy economy up and running by any means possible.</strong></p><br><p><strong>Author:</strong><br/>\n<span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/cutthebirch\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7000329); return false;\"><img alt=\"CutTheBirch\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7000329&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334086\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7000329)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/cutthebirch\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7000329); return false;\">CutTheBirch</a></span><br/>\n<a href=\"/cutthebirch\">Author Page</a></p><br><p><strong>Images:</strong><br/>\n<a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Candykingpussi.jpg\">Candykingpussi</a> by <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Kulmalukko\">Kulmalukko</a> is licensed under <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\">CC BY-SA 3.0</a>, edited by <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/cutthebirch\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7000329); return false;\"><img alt=\"CutTheBirch\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7000329&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334086\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7000329)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/cutthebirch\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7000329); return false;\">CutTheBirch</a></span></p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/object-4\">Object 4</a> | Object 5 | <a href=\"/object-6\">Object 6</a> \u00bb</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/object-5\">Object 5 - \"Candy\"</a>\" by CutTheBirch, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

    "title": "Object 6 - \"The Mirror\"",
    "description": "<p><strong>Object 6</strong> is a large, seemingly ordinary wall mirror hung underneath a green exit sign. It is situated in a nondescript room within <a href=\"/level-0\">Level 0</a>, though this room appears to be exceedingly remote and difficult to locate. The object has not been sighted in other levels, and its movement is consistent with the random reshuffling of rooms typical to Level 0.</p><br><p>The mirror is rectangular in shape, with a height of 97.1 inches (246.6cm) and width of 61.9 inches (157.2cm), with a thickness of 0.24 inches (0.61cm). Its surface is uniformly smooth, apart from a small plaque centered on the mirror\u2019s bottom edge.</p><br><p>The plaque reads as follows:</p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:250%;\"><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman\">REALITY</span></span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman\">1 Cori 13 | 12</span></span></p><br><p>The text's meaning stands undeciphered. The link between the text on the plaque and the mirror's properties has yet to be determined.</p><br><p>To all viewers, the mirror initially appears and behaves as an ordinary wall mirror. However, its anomalous properties begin to manifest within hours of exposure.</p><br><p>The majority of viewers have claimed that the reflection within the mirror is soon replaced with scenes featuring people, places and objects which are integral to their past lives in the Frontrooms, and fondly remembered. Viewers' homes, neighborhoods, schools, and workplaces are usually featured, as well as loved ones, family members and pets.</p><br><p>Viewers generally assert that the scenes depicted are peaceful and ordinary. All characters, objects and places within scenes behave normally and are accurate to the viewer's memory. Viewers also deny seeing the Backrooms and its unique features appearing within these scenes. Intriguingly, some viewers have even claimed to see deceased family members and pets appearing in scenes, as well as places which no longer exist.</p><br><p>Viewers also describe being unable to interact in any way with the scenes depicted in the mirror. However, they unanimously report seeing a version of themselves incorporated into the scenes at all times. A viewer\u2019s counterpart within the reflection will apparently bear close resemblance to their current age and appearance, but dressed appropriately to the scene.</p><br><p>A minority of viewers do claim that they are physically unable to experience the mirror's unusual properties. For these viewers, the mirror continues to function as a standard wall mirror. Research has suggested that most such individuals were born in the Backrooms, or have lived within them for an extended period.</p><br><p>There are also unverified rumors of entirely different scenes reflected within the mirror. These claims range wildly from scenes set within the Backrooms to scenes set in mythical or fictional places. Research into such rumors is ongoing.</p><br><p>The response to the scenes within the mirror varies greatly. As expected, viewers tend to express wistful, nostalgic emotions. Most break down in tears. Some viewers forcefully (and thus far unsuccessfully) attempt to break through the mirror into the scene itself. Though the recorded responses of viewers are generally consistent with their personality, researchers are investigating the possibility of the mirror exerting an additional psychic effect upon their emotions.</p><br><p>Some viewers do find it emotionally difficult to leave the mirror behind. Most viewers report no serious physical, mental or emotional ill-effects after leaving the mirror. Viewers tend to report feeling wistful and nostalgic for many hours after exposure, but it is assumed that this is a natural emotional response. Many also report feeling calm and relieved, and express a sense of closure at being able to experience a glimpse of reality once again.</p><br><p>All photographic and videographic attempts to document the phenomena exhibited by the mirror have been unsuccessful, as they merely yield images of the mirror reflecting an empty room. Researchers therefore speculate that the illusory effects of the mirror might be hallucinatory.</p><br><p>Under intense scrutiny before and during the manifestation of the mirror's effects, no physical abnormalities or technological enhancements have been found on the object. However, the mirror appears to be impervious to scratches and damage in any form, and the mirror cannot be dislodged from the wall by any means.</p><br><p>Attempting to attack or destroy the mirror is <strong>strongly discouraged</strong><sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> due to the risk of damaging it before its full potential is discovered and harnessed. Furthermore, any such attempt poses a danger to Wanderers, as the mirror appears to react defensively to attacks (refer to the attached Audio Log for details).</p><br><p>It is assumed that the mirror itself is responsible for its effects, and not the room around it. The room in which the mirror is placed is indeed consistent with the appearance and behaviour of Level 0. However, it appears to be Euclidian in nature, and does not change in size and shape while unobserved \u2014 similar to the <a href=\"/manila-room\">Manila Room</a>.</p><br><p>As an apparent side-effect of the room's stable geometry, no-clipping into or out of the room is not possible. Unfortunately, this makes the object incredibly difficult to locate within the non-Euclidian geometry of Level 0. It also appears to be impossible to no-clip through the mirror itself (or at least \u2014 not intentionally. Refer to the attached Audio Log for details).</p><br><p>Research on Object 6 is proceeding slowly because of navigational difficulties. <strong>Therefore, The M.E.G. encourages anyone with information of the mirror's origin and function to come forward, particularly if an individual named Cori is involved. Anecdotal evidence from anyone who has encountered the mirror is also greatly appreciated.</strong></p><br><p>Rumours about the object had been circulating among Wanderers for years prior to its official discovery. The object came to the M.E.G.'s attention when speculation began of its potential as an exit from the Backrooms. The M.E.G. officially confirmed the existence of the mirror on 3/24/2021, when it was successfully located by M.E.G. Team 'Troglodyte' of Regiment Track Mappers.</p><br><p>Attached below is a transcript of the Audio Log submitted by M.E.G. Team 'Troglodyte' upon return.</p><br><p>The comprehensive testing log on the mirror and its properties is also available <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTT5iHCHSn0\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p><br><p><strong>2nd Lieutenant Evan M. Hope:</strong> Hello Base Command, this is Team Leader Evan Hope of Team Troglodyte. We've found what you're looking for. Damn this took a while.</p><br><p><strong>Base:</strong> This is Commrunner Jas from M.E.G. Base Beta Command Facility, we hear you loud and clear Trog- Troglo-\u2026 why does this have to be your name\u2026 Anyway, what\u2019s your status?</p><br><p><strong>Evan:</strong> I think we\u2019re here. We\u2019ve found an object matching your description. A mirror and an exit sign. Awaiting further instructions.</p><br><p><strong>Base:</strong> Excellent. Please specify the route taken since our last Comms check. We\u2019ll record it for now, in case your team\u2026 doesn\u2019t make it back in one piece.</p><br><p><strong>Evan:</strong> Really? It's Level 0, we can pretty much no-clip back to base any time. I could just send Savant back with the Carto logs if you need it <em>that</em> urgently.</p><br><p><strong>Base:</strong> Your team entered from <a href=\"/level-3\">Level 3</a>. We\u2019re not taking any chances after <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ\">that incident with Theo</a>.</p><br><p><strong>Evan:</strong> If you insist. SAVANT! Get over here.</p><br><p>[Background conversation is audible for about thirty seconds.]</p><br><p><strong>2nd Sergeant Savant J. Pryce:</strong> Command, this is Savant speaking. According to my logs we have walked thirty-seven and a quarter miles east since our last Communications check. That makes 246.5 miles since our rendezvous in <a href=\"/manila-room\">Manila</a>.</p><br><p><strong>Evan:</strong> Don't understand how it would help when everything keeps moving around in here.</p><br><p><strong>Savant:</strong> Actually, with enough time and patience, there are a few navigational patterns that aid in non-Euclidian cartography. There are definitely patterns of movement that can get us to specific rooms, especially ones with atypical properties. The Manila Room for example-</p><br><p><strong>Evan:</strong> Yeah, we get it Bill Nye, go do something useful. Oh yeah - tell the guys to drink up, we've been walking for hours.</p><br><p>[2SG Savant mumbles inaudibly.]</p><br><p><strong>Base:</strong> Thank you, Savant.</p><br><p><strong>Evan:</strong> This better be worth it, Jas. I don't like sending my guys out here for nothing. It's been almost a week of this drywall, pissfloor nightmare, and we had to take a detour into the <a href=\"/red-rooms\">Red Rooms</a> because of Jared-</p><br><p>[In the background, faintly]</p><br><p><strong>Corporal Jared E. Lasky</strong>: It was Bailey\u2019s fault!</p><br><p>[Friendly banter is audible in the background for a few moments]</p><br><p><strong>Base:</strong> Sorry to hear that. The higher-ups said this was a priority mission, so it's bound to be important. How is your team?</p><br><p><strong>Evan:</strong> We\u2019re a little worn out. Permission to set up camp for a couple hours? No way we can conduct research in this state.</p><br><p><strong>Base:</strong> Of course. Just one more thing - could you describe what you see? And send us a pic of the mirror.</p><br><p><strong>Evan:</strong> Well, there\u2019s nothing notable about the room. Same crap-hole level 0 aesthetic as far as we can see. It\u2019s a square room\u2026 maybe as big as the gaming lounge back at Base. No entities in sight.</p><br><p><strong>Base:</strong> Okay, but the mirror.</p><br><p><strong>Evan:</strong> The mirror, right. It's under an exit sign, like we were told\u2026</p><br><p>[A long pause. The clinking of tent poles and equipment is audible in the background. Loud tapping noises are heard.]</p><br><p><strong>Evan:</strong> You sure this thing\u2019s worth looking at? It\u2019s just\u2026 a mirror. Like\u2026 the kind you\u2019d find in a clothing store on Level 11. Nothing special. There is a plaque on the bottom, can't tell what it's supposed to mean, but it's probably just some product serial number or something. I can take a pic of that.</p><br><p><strong>Base:</strong> Okay.</p><br><p><strong>Evan:</strong> I swear, if this turns out like the <em>MONTH LONG</em> search for an <em>ORDINARY</em> coat rack from last year\u2026 You better be sure there\u2019s something special about this- oh.</p><br><p><strong>Base:</strong> You good?</p><br><p><strong>Evan:</strong> I've taken a photo, as requested. But it\u2019s\u2026 empty?</p><br><p><strong>Base:</strong> Come again?</p><br><p><strong>Evan:</strong> There\u2019s\u2026 I\u2019m not in it. My reflection doesn\u2019t show up. It\u2019s just the room, totally empty. Yo Savant, come see this.</p><br><p>[A long pause.]</p><br><p><strong>Savant:</strong> The photographs are indeed\u2026 entirely empty. We have tried altering the angle and the lighting, but the result remains the same. Taking a photograph of Evan in front of the mirror causes him to appear in the image, but not his reflection. That is very odd.</p><br><p><strong>Base:</strong> Maybe, but it lines up with the reports we've gotten. We\u2019ll talk again at 0800 hours tomorrow. Have a good rest, and keep your comms online in case the mirror does anything strange.</p><br><p><strong>Evan:</strong> Alright, pics sent, I will see you in the morning.</p><br><p><strong>Base:</strong> Command out.</p><br><p>[The recording on Troglodyte's end continues uneventfully for approximately two hours, during which casual chatter and eating noises are audible]</p><br><p><strong>Jared:</strong> So I was telling her, right, I should\u2019ve\u2026 what?</p><br><p><strong>Corporal Bailey R. Pauling:</strong> GUYS. In the mirror!</p><br><p><strong>Savant:</strong> What?</p><br><p><strong>Jared:</strong> I don't see anything?</p><br><p><strong>Bailey:</strong> It's MY MOM!</p><br><p>[There is a pause. In the post-mission brief, 2LT Evan reported that CPL Bailey rushed towards the mirror at this point.]</p><br><p><strong>Bailey:</strong> Mom! Can you see me? Can you hear me?</p><br><p>[CPL Bailey begins banging forcefully on the mirror, to no apparent effect. There is a long pause.]</p><br><p><strong>Evan:</strong> Bailey? We don't see anything.</p><br><p><strong>Bailey:</strong> My mom! I see her, she's right there, sitting at the kitchen table\u2026 it's been years\u2026</p><br><p><strong>Savant:</strong> Describe clearly what you see, Bailey. Stay calm and speak slowly. It could be important.</p><br><p><strong>Bailey:</strong> I\u2026 My mom\u2026 she's\u2026 sitting down for breakfast\u2026 coffee and cereal with soy milk\u2026 like she always does.</p><br><p><strong>Savant:</strong> Where is she?</p><br><p><strong>Bailey:</strong> She's sitting in our kitchen. In- in Redding. Minnesota<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup>. That's where I used to live.</p><br><p><strong>Jared:</strong> What does your house look like?</p><br><p><strong>Bailey:</strong> Exactly like I remember it. It's an apartment, on the fifth floor. The walls are purple, because my Mom likes purple. There's blue-striped curtains. It's rainy outside and the ceiling's still dripping, and there's a bucket underneath. And my cat, Moss- WAIT. I'm\u2026 I'm there too! In the background. I'm feeding my cat.</p><br><p>[2LT Evan reports that the group has, at this point, crowded around CPL Bailey in front of the mirror. He has begun holding the mic up to Bailey to record the audio clearly]</p><br><p><strong>Jared:</strong> Still don't see anything. If you're making this up\u2026</p><br><p><strong>Bailey:</strong> I'm not, I swear I'm not. I\u2026 I'm sitting there in front of my cat. Not fourteen-year-old me, the <em>now</em> me. I'm still in my favourite T-shirt though. It was, like, a blue shirt with a camera printed on, with, like, the UK flag in the lens. And\u2026 my slippers. The furry ones the M.E.G. found on me when I fell in here.</p><br><p>[Pause.]</p><br><p><strong>Bailey:</strong> I'm changing into my sneakers now. And my mom, I'm hugging her goodbye and leaving for school\u2026 I haven't seen her in years. I\u2026 I love her so much. I miss her.</p><br><p>[There is a long pause. Sobbing and comforting whispers are barely audible]</p><br><p><strong>Evan:</strong> Go take a rest, guys. I'll stay with Bailey and take first watch.</p><br><p>[Silence for another five or so minutes. Evan begins to speak, quietly and thoughtfully.]</p><br><p><strong>Evan:</strong> You wanna talk about it?</p><br><p>[A long pause]</p><br><p><strong>Bailey:</strong> My mom. She was great, you know? When dad had that accident, and we didn't know if- if we could ever move on. She worked two jobs and still came home and made dinner every night. I miss her. I miss them. I miss when\u2026 life was normal. I even miss school. I- I just\u2026 wanna be a kid again. To go back to Reality, you know?</p><br><p>[A brief pause.]</p><br><p><strong>Evan:</strong> I'm not seeing what you see. But I get what you mean.</p><br><p><strong>Bailey:</strong> What was it like\u2026 for you? Back there?</p><br><p>[A long pause]</p><br><p><strong>Evan:</strong> Not great, dude. My brother\u2026 he wasn't the best. His friends liked to come over\u2026 they would smoke weed and do- uh\u2026 other things. My parents were away a lot. He had to take care of me. He didn't do a good job.</p><br><p>[The next four minutes of the audio log have been cut at the request of 2LT Evan.]</p><br><p><strong>Evan:</strong> So you see, it's not all that bad. Now that we're here. We still have each other.</p><br><p><strong>Bailey:</strong> *sniff* Maybe.</p><br><p>[A long pause.]</p><br><p><strong>Bailey:</strong> You think there's a way back?</p><br><p><strong>Evan:</strong> Well\u2026 I really dunno. Never really thought about it. I don't exactly have much to go back to.</p><br><p>[Long pause]</p><br><p><strong>Evan:</strong> I think\u2026 well, don't take this the wrong way. But I've always wondered, you know. If the Reality we came from was actually\u2026 real. If maybe\u2026 the Backrooms is Reality. And the place we thought we knew\u2026 and we thought we came from\u2026 what if that's the illusion?</p><br><p>[Long pause]</p><br><p><strong>Bailey:</strong> That's\u2026 real depressing.</p><br><p><strong>Evan:</strong> Well\u2026 more for you than for me, I guess. We don't know if there's a way back. And even if there is, we don't know if life will ever be the same. It's likely everyone we used to know has just moved on at this point. But whatever happens, we've got each other and we have the M.E.G. No matter what this pissfloor shithole throws at us, we'll be alright.</p><br><p><strong>Bailey:</strong> Yeah\u2026 I guess.</p><br><p><strong>Evan:</strong> And hey\u2026 if we die\u2026 maybe we wake up in our beds, and reality goes on like normal. Not gonna test that out, though.</p><br><p><strong>Bailey:</strong> Me neither.</p><br><p>[Long pause]</p><br><p><strong>Evan:</strong> Look\u2026 we're here for you. Alright? Me and Savant\u2026 even Jared. We're a team. Look, my life before might've been shitty, but even I can say it's not easy in here. If you ever need to talk\u2026 we're here. And I'm here.</p><br><p><strong>Bailey:</strong> Yeah.

    "title": "Object 7 - \"Memory Jar\"",
    "description": "<p>Memory Jars take the appearance of an empty glass jar similar to those in The Frontrooms. They have tight lids that are impossible to take off by normal means. They have two different phases; one is the deactivated phase, where they are just as previously described. In their deactivated phase, they hold no anomalous properties, apart from the lid being impossible to remove. Memory jars are activated when a person holding, or in close proximity to jar dies. When this event happens, the jar fills with \"Memories.\" Once the activation happens, it is possible, and easy to remove the lid.</p><br><p>Memories are small glowing orbs that fill up memory jars when they enter their active state. They possess a strange property of floating, causing them to fly to the roof. These memories are physical representations of the memories from the dead person who causes the activation of a Memory Jar. Touching a memory will play it in your mind's eye, as if it had been your own. These memories all share the same color, but depend on the personality of the ex-holder.</p><br><p><strong>Pink Memory</strong><br/>\nJars that contain pink memories were held by generally cheerful or optimistic people.<br/>\n<strong>Blue Memory</strong><br/>\nThe polar opposite of pink memory jars, would have been held by people who have a general negative outlook, or have been sad most of their life.<br/>\n<strong>Red Memory</strong><br/>\nRed memories come from people who had a violent and aggressive personality, or might have done many evil deeds.<br/>\n<strong>Green Memory</strong><br/>\nJars with green memories are held by people who were calm and/or lazy.<br/>\n<strong>Purple Memory</strong><br/>\nA jar with purple memories would have been held by a person who had a timid and shy personality.<br/>\n<strong>Yellow Memory</strong><br/>\nThe opposite of the purple memory, yellow memories would come from brave and outgoing people.<br/>\n<strong>Black Memory</strong><br/>\nBlack memories are unique, as they are held by entities.</p><br><p>Memory Jars are most common in <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/the-memory\">The Memory</a>, where many empty jars can be located. The most efficient way to find a Memory Jar is to look for Memoria Rooms, the locations in <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/the-memory\">The Memory</a> where empty Memory Jars can be found. They can also be found on most levels outside of <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/the-memory\">The Memory</a> as well, however they are considerably rarer, with less than 200 reports of locating them outside <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/the-memory\">The Memory</a>. The safest way to obtain a Memory Jar is by trading for one with the B.N.T.G. or obtaining one through gambling in <a href=\"/level-5-1\">Level 5.1</a>.</p><br><p>Memory Jars are popular in trading, and some people earn serious amounts of useful resources by selling the Memory Jars of famous individuals. Due to this, Memory Jar collecting is a popular hobby in The Backrooms and is a recommended item for people new to trading. Finding a memory jar on the ground can also be crucial for survival, because the memories inside may alert you to a nearby threat.</p><br><p><span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/niko-discord\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6627307); return false;\"><img alt=\"Niko_Discord\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=6627307&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334085\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=6627307)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/niko-discord\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6627307); return false;\">Niko_Discord</a></span><br/>\nOld version greenlit by <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/stretchsterz\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6287336); return false;\"><img alt=\"Stretchsterz\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=6287336&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334085\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=6287336)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/stretchsterz\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6287336); return false;\">Stretchsterz</a></span></p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/object-6\">Object 6</a> | Object 7 | <a href=\"/object-8\">Object 8</a> \u00bb</p><br>",

    "title": "Object 9 - \"Dumb Gum\" (They bleed onto the desert ever so nicely.)",
    "description": "<p>An instance of the orange variation of <strong>Dumb Gum</strong>, found within a vending machine in Level 201. This instance of <strong>Dumb Gum</strong> was presumably formed in a cold area.</p><br><p><strong>Object 9</strong>, also commonly referred to as <strong>Dumb Gum</strong>, is a soft, edible substance that's visually similar to chewing gum found in the Frontrooms. It has a generally rubbery consistency due to its composition of melted sand, though remains relatively solid when left untouched due to the formation process which compacts its interior.</p><br><p><strong>Dumb Gum</strong> can be found in a variety of different colors and shapes, though mainly appears as either a light violet or warm orange color. This is largely due to its formation process; it starts out as sand deep below the dunes of <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-201\" target=\"_blank\">Level 201</a>, but pressure of the sand above it causes it to slowly rise in heat. This heat melts the sand, turning it into a soft substance, which will slowly cool down and harden over time, producing instances of <strong>Object 9</strong>. The form that the <strong>Dumb Gum</strong> shapes into is dependent on which area of Level 201 it is created in. If made along the shore, waves from the ocean will cause the molten sand to rise in large sheets, which would then subsequently break into their respective rectangular pieces. If made in one of the more chilly sections of the level, the cold will cause it to harden and compact into smaller pieces which also have a much firmer exterior.</p><br><p>When consumed, <strong>Dumb Gum</strong> doesn't appear to cause any immediate abnormal effects. It has been described as having an extremely citrusy flavor which may cause one to spit it out upon first trying it. Individuals who have consumed this have stated that this flavor is very unique and they haven't been able to recreate it any other way, despite many attempts. Some individuals have been reported to regularly intake <strong>Object 9</strong> and suffer its effects despite the mental strain it causes them.</p><br><p>Thirty minutes after consumption, recipients of the effects claim to feel a painful burning sensation within the back of their throats which gets increasingly irritating as time goes on, ceasing as soon as the next set of effects take place. Individuals will then slowly begin to lose motor skills, such as being able to stand, intake liquids, walking, talking, swimming, and, in rare cases, the ability to blink or breathe twenty minutes after the burning sensation is experienced. Five minutes following these effects, the individual affected will then faint for around an hour, waking up with no memory of what transpired whilst they were under its influence.</p><br><p><span style=\"color: white\"><em>C'mon dude, this will be an epic prank!</em></span><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>I don't know bro, where did you even get this stuff?</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color: white\"><em>201, man!

    "description": "<p>Ghost Lights are commonly found on levels with shadowy corners, though most occurrences of this object have been reported on <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-74\">Level 74</a>. The object itself resembles a single incandescent bulb on an aging metal stand. Object 11 ranges from about 3 to 6 feet in height, and the metal stand appears hand-wrought of either brass or iron. No matter its size, Ghost Lights are incredibly heavy, sometimes over 100 pounds in weight, and can be difficult to move.</p><br><p>The lightbulb posted at the top of the fixture is always on, but it occasionally pulses and flickers. Object 11 generates its own light independent of an electric source and its lightbulb is always hot to the touch. Attempts to break the object through physical force have failed presumably due to the strength of the glass and metal. The bulb takes on a classic Victorian shape, and the light produced appears to be from a sodium filament which basks its surroundings in a yellowish-orange light. In most documented cases of Object 11 the light reaches a radius of about 15 feet, however, some have shed far less light and there have been reports of some found that barely produce a flicker.</p><br><p><a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-m-e-g\">M.E.G.</a> researchers have observed anomalous specters flitting in and out of radius of the Ghost Light. These anomalies range from costumed people moving about to spectral shapes dancing. Apparitions promptly vanish when leaving the proximity of Object 11, as do the temporary, mind-altering effects of exposure to the object. Observers outside of the light radius may see human-like apparitions in the light, several operatives have also described sounds akin to a pit orchestra warming up emanating from a Ghost Light.<br/></p><br><p>Humanoid entities, such as <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-6\">dullers</a> and <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-8\">hounds</a>, will not enter the Ghost Light's radius. The <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-m-e-g\">M.E.G.</a> hypothesizes that humanoid entities can also experience the Dream State, however, this is currently an ongoing investigation. There have been reports of single entities stopping pursuit and watching the fleeing wanderer from the darkness. Various observations have been made with entities and the Ghost Light, notably some involving <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-8\">hounds</a>. The entities often struggle and will fight to escape when exposed to the Ghost Light. Some have injured themselves while trying to escape the object, with a hound even coming away with a shattered femur as it fled. Further examinations upon capture have proven that the light itself did not cause any noticeable harm to the creature. Testing demonstrated inconsistent results with some subjects appearing wholly unaffected while others seemed to slip into the Dream State.</p><br><p>If as few as three entities, including <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-1\">humans</a>, gather around the object, the lightbulb will completely shatter leaving hapless explorers with a useless metal pole. Furthermore, anything caught in the light radius when the bulb shatters will be stunned, causing them to reel and stumble. Several wanderers exposed to a shattered bulb have reported migraine-like side effects that can last extended periods of time depending on how long their exposure was to the light. While the safe zone isn't infallible, it can temporarily help a wanderer defend against entities hunting them.</p><br><p>Wanderers who enter the light radius will gradually succumb to the object's Dream State. These effects are proximity based, so moving away from the Ghost Light is advised until the effects subside. The rate of immersion varies between each individual but can be accelerated by closer proximity to the Ghost Light, preexisting exhaustion and the presence of other entities. Furthermore, proximity has a significant effect on what the wanderer experiences. Those on the outskirts may only see flitting specters dancing around them, while those closer may see full apparitions or hear ambient, strange music. In order to fully enter the Dream State, wanderers must remain relatively close to the object for a prolonged period of time.</p><br><p>Once in the Dream State, they will suddenly see themselves on a grand stage, performing some sort of play. Experiences have ranged from famous musicals similar to those performed in <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-frontrooms\">the Frontrooms</a> to plays in strange languages. The stage reportedly resembles a grand European theater with decor and architecture from the early 1800s. The sprawling balconies feature elaborate, gilded floral trim and the seats are carpeted with red velvet. Wanderers have reported that the theater is filled with a cheering audience garbed in ornate clothing and adorning smiling, white masks that obscure their faces.</p><br><p>Those fully immersed in the Dream State will actually perform, acting out lines and scenes from the play or musical, even in languages they don't know or from plays they haven't seen. To an observer, the afflicted person will begin loudly acting regardless of whatever may be lurking near them. The amount of time for which the effects of the Dream State lasts is inconsistent, however, the effects can be reversed if the person is removed from the glow of the Ghost Light. Furthermore, having the light shatter while entranced will immediately the cease Dream State for all affected by the object. Acting skill is greatly inconsistent from person to person, with some wanderers completely butchering their interpretation of whatever play they are envisioning. If the acting is deemed subpar by the hallucinated audience, they will reportedly file out of the theater and the wanderer will exit the Dream State. <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-m-e-g\">M.E.G.</a> research has shown the more someone has been involved in theater, the more potent the effects are and they will act out more complex performances.</p><br><p>Instances of multiple wanderers being affected by the Dream State have occurred with varying results. Some have reported them collaborating with others in the hallucination while others have broken from the state, angry at being upstaged. Wanderers deep within the Dream State are still able to tell other wanderers apart from hallucinated people due to the absence of clothes appropriate for the performance.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>The following is a log describing <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-m-e-g\">M.E.G.</a> sanctioned experiments and interactions using Object 11.</strong><br/></p><br><p><strong>M.E.G. Data Entry - Experiment Audio Log 11: Ghost Lights</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nTranscript:<br/>\n<em>Hello, my name is Doctor Everett Kyne and I am so thrilled to be here on <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-74\">Level 74</a> to finally experiment with a Ghost Light. I've seen one before, a kind sight after overstaying my welcome in <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-74\">Level 74</a>, and I have been eager to see everything they can do. I've been waiting a long time to experiment with one of these, ever since I partially experienced the Dream State for myself. Unfortunately, I am a terrible performer and my audience was\u2026displeased with my performance. It has been entrusted to me to gather data and discern the true nature of the object, and I'm excited to report my findings.</em><br/>\n<br/>\n<em>A special thanks to our participant who will be exposed to the Ghost Light to help test its fascinating properties. Due to the uncertainty of the extent to which the effects remain post-exposure, precautions have been taken, such as being ready to remove the participant from the light. During their first exposure, it took about an hour for the Dream State to set in. They reported seeing actors around them in some sort of masquerade, all of them adorning vintage clothes. After resting, we proceeded with both the thirty and forty-five minute increments, however, the participant stated that not much changed. The hour mark made a big difference though. They gave me a jolt when I heard them shout, <strong>\"ZEUS!\"</strong>. The participant was standing, their posture rather dramatic as their hands indicated toward the Ghost Light. <strong>\"Great welcome voice of Zeus, what do you bring? What word from the gold vaults of Delphi comes to brilliant Thebes?\"</strong> The participant began to prance and dance around the Ghost Light, moving their arms in a graceful manner. <strong>Racked with terror - terror shakes my heart and I cry your wild cries, Apollo, Healer of Delos, I worship you in dread\u2026what now, what is your price?\"</strong></em><br/>\n<br/>\n<em>I had goosebumps. Not only had the participant been fully enthralled by the Ghost Light, but they had also rather eloquently quoted Oedipus Rex. Satisfied with their interpretation of Sophocles, I quickly pulled them out of the experiment. It took forty minutes or so to recover, but what they told me was wonderful. The participant had been transported to an incredible venue, complete with hundreds of people cheering for them. They somehow knew their lines to perfection, all of the movements they made felt like pure instinct.</em><br/>\n<br/>\n<em>After returning to a secure location, I wanted to record some more of my thoughts. Entities avoid it, humans are bewitched by it. But how does it work? It's yet another Backrooms mystery, something we can never truly unravel since most of the things here defy our functional knowledge of the known world. I'm excited to experiment more with the Ghost Light. I wonder what other secrets this object holds. I suppose only time will tell.</em><br/>\n<br/>\nEnd transcript.</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/object-11\">Object 11</a>\" by DivineAtlas, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

    "description": "<p>Object 13 is a computer terminal that can occasionally be found within <a href=\"/level-4\">Level 4</a>. If the power button is pushed, the computer will turn on, and a chat session will begin, connected to all other Object 13 terminals. As of writing, no two people who have used an Object 13 terminal have been able to find each other within the Backrooms, so it is possible that the entire chat is a facade created by the computer. Whether real or not, talking within the chat can provide valuable information to help you survive, as long as whoever you're talking to isn't being unhelpful or trying to trick you.</p><br><p>Although the terminals can be fairly heavy, they can be brought with you by unplugging them and re-plugging them into other outlets. Shopping carts can be brought into Level 4 from <a href=\"/level-176\">Level 176</a>; anything that makes it easier to carry a terminal around is good.</p><br><p>A number of people have managed to take a terminal out of Level 4 and into other levels, although this is only useful in places where there are outlets. The terminals still work and connect to the chat room even when in other levels.</p><br><p>The chat system behaves as a rudimentary text channel. When you first turn on the computer, you are asked to enter a username for yourself. This name will appear beside your messages in the chat, and it will be bound to you. Whenever you access a terminal, even a new terminal, you will have that name. So don't choose something dumb.</p><br><p>There is only a single chat room available, and there is no private messaging system. The chat usually has between five and fifteen people at once. There are chat \"moderators\" that exist to remove people who spam in the text chat. We're not sure what they are, but they definitely aren't human. The moderators seem to exist somewhere within the Backrooms outside the computers, but we aren't sure where or how. In the text chat, moderators have blue names. They only show up rarely.</p><br><p>Object 13 had been rumored to exist for some time, but it wasn't definitive until a user took the above photograph and screencapped the following chat log.</p><br><p><strong>BenTen:</strong> So I'm in this closet, yeah?

    "description": "<p>Scarabacks are crude, dung beetle-shaped figurines carved on what superficially resembles lapis lazuli, but in a much darker shade of blue. They can be roughly between 5 to 15 centimeters in size. They are also painted over using white paint, either to draw details on the sculpture or rather written as a set of hieroglyphs on the base, usually reading a quick prayer to the Egyptian god Khepri<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup>. These objects do not seem to have a definite origin, but are rather found on corpses of the Lost faction known as the Dynasty of the New Sun. It is to note that the usage of these talismans by an outsider is a grave offense to said faction.</p><br><p>Unlike regular scarab carvings<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup> , Scarabacks are able to animate themselves. If the prayer on the base is whispered to the object; the beetle will spread its wings, make a loud droning noise, and begin to emit blue light for up to a minute. A simple \"thank you\" in any language is enough to make the Scaraback revert back to its inanimate state for 2 hours, becoming unusable for the duration of said time. An Entity may also be able to turn this Object into its passive mode, although how exactly it is done is currently unknown.</p><br><p>While active, Scaraback light seems to be able to stun most Entities that prefer the dark; and may also be able to temporarily blind humans if the environment is gloomy enough. In addition, the droning noise appears to be irritating to many dangerous Entities, who will attempt to get away from the source of said noise.</p><br><p>Most travelers with these objects in their possession use their Scarabacks as an Entity repellant, as its light and noise are able to make even a Smiler recoil back.

    "description": "<p>Firesalt is a volatile crystalline formation found within the Backrooms. They are most commonly found as irregular shaped shards between 1 and 5\u00a0cm in size, colored orange and slightly translucent. Large artificial firesalt ingots on the other hand are more transparent and colored a dark shade of red.</p><br><p>Molten firesalt, nicknamed pyroil, is a colorless flammable liquid with a smell reminiscent of incense.</p><br><p>Firesalt crystals are relatively hard, classifying in the Mohs Scale of mineral hardness as a 7<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> but are quite brittle making them vulnerable to impact damage. They are also soluble in water and almond water, generating heat when dissolving in both liquids.</p><br><p>In addition, they have a low fusion point of approximately 47\u00a0\u00b0C, whereupon reaching said threshold the crystals melt into clear pyroil, which is able to efficiently burn even on low oxygen atmospheres. Furthermore, pyroil can be cooled down to create large artificial firesalt ingots.</p><br><p>Firesalts most coveted property is its reactivity against impact damage. When thrown, firesalt crystals easily shatter, generating a moderate quantity of heat and a remarkable quantity of light in the shape of burning sparks, enough to cause first or second-degree burns on humans with a direct hit. Larger manufactured ingots or crystals of a mass greater than 50 grams are able to explode in a manner similar to TNT, equating to approximately half the energy of a dynamite stick for a firesalt ingot of 100 grams. It is to note that the aforementioned explosion does not seem to damage the overall integrity of the Backrooms themselves.</p><br><p>Small firesalt crystals are used by Backrooms explorers as self-defense weapons as they can be easily primed and its small explosive can be used to surprise, hurt, or scare away both hostile entities and humans. Its overall common nature makes firesalt the weapon of choice of many explorers; often being fashioned into simple-to-carry firecrackers. Large ingots however are used as a tool of war, as its destructive power can easily obliterate enemy platoons or hordes of entities. However, the infrastructure needed to create sizable quantities of such ingots ensures that only large or well-prepared organizations or factions are able to produce them.</p><br><p>Moreover, some use the heat released when dissolving firesalt in water and almond water to boil foodstuffs and liquids making a couple of firesalt crystals an easy alternative to making a potentially dangerous fire in order to disinfect any harvested almond water from the Disease or other maladies.<br/>\nPyroil on the other hand has been used as a substitute to gasoline to power any small vehicle within the Backrooms, as well as fuel to any generators if no electric outlets are available.</p><br><p>Small firesalt crystals can be obtained growing on corners within the first 5 Levels of the Backrooms, as well as in smaller, rarer quantities in levels similar to Level 0. However, larger explosive firesalt crystals cannot be found naturally, but rather have to be manufactured by melting together several crystals. Pyroil can only be obtained through the fusion of firesalt crystals as well.</p><br><p>~ <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/will-anomaler\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(3992515); return false;\"><img alt=\"Will Anomaler\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=3992515&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334085\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=3992515)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/will-anomaler\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(3992515); return false;\">Will Anomaler</a></span></p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/object-14\">Object 14</a> | Object 15 | <a href=\"/object-16\">Object 16</a> \u00bb</p><br>",

Descriptions of what it tastes like however, greatly vary among subjects; ranging from a mildly sweet and delectable taste, to what was described as 'a feast fit for a god'.</p><br><p>Eating any amount of it will provide the same nourishment as 3 proper meals.

    "title": "Object 17 - \"Liquid Silence\"",
    "description": "<p>Liquid Silence is a black, viscous liquid comprised from the remains of <a href=\"/entity-97\">Scream Eaters</a>; ethereal and hostile creatures found only in <a href=\"/level-93\">Level 93</a>. Large amounts of this liquid can induce spontaneous extreme fear in Entities and wanderers within a thirty meter radius. Liquid Silence is an incredibly unique substance due to its ability to absorb and store sound. Because of this, Liquid Silence is highly useful in a myriad of applications.</p><br><p>Each particle of Liquid Silence contains a pocket dimension that can hold an amount of sound relative to the amount of Liquid Silence. One liter of Liquid Silence has the capacity to contain up to 191 decibels, which roughly equates to the power of a hand grenade. Once a particle of Liquid Silence has reached maximum capacity, it will lose its sound absorbent properties completely. Applying an electrical current of 1 volt or more to Liquid Silence causes a spontaneous temporary collapse of its pocket dimension. All stored sound is released within a very short span of time measuring in microseconds. Removing the electrical current restores the pocket dimension instantly.</p><br><p>Crystal oscillators can cause a rapid pulsing electrical current that repeatedly collapses and restores the pocket dimension, allowing for a slow release of the stored sound since a small amount escapes each cycle.</p><br><p>Liquid Silence dries and becomes a black powdery material when its temperature rises above 0\u00b0 Celsius. It bears a resemblance similar to charcoal powder, however it is grainier and tends to form in clumps. The powder form of Liquid Silence retains its sound absorbent properties.</p><br><p>The powdered form of Liquid Silence. Similar to charcoal powder, but much chunkier in nature.</p><br><p>A strange and seemingly random property of Liquid Silence is its ability to induce fear within entities and wanderers in close proximity - around twenty to thirty meters, with large amounts of the substance causing extreme hysteria if one finds themselves within a meter. Even small amounts of Liquid Silence produce a sense of uneasiness when near, however products created using Liquid Silence have minimal to no effect, presumably due to dilution and other unknown processes. It seems Phantoms utilise this fear mechanism in order to 'feed' on their victims.</p><br><p>Liquid Silence can be combined with metals and other materials during the creation process to create 'silent' versions. Silent rubber is often used to create shoe soles and gloves that create next to no sound when travelling around in situations such as walking through leaves or handling loud objects. These shoes and gloves are invaluable to the average wanderer and are traded at a high price.</p><br><p>Silent metals usually contain a black tint and are used in melee weaponry or utility tools. Silent iron crowbars are very useful, since the usual loud noises that occur when forcing open compartments and bludgeoning hostile entities are no longer created. Silent metal also has uses in firearms, where they can eliminate sound if built into the barrel and chassis of a weapon.</p><br><p>Liquid Silence is also a very powerful explosive weapon. Repurposed Smiler Canisters can be filled with Liquid Silence, up to 89 liters. At maximum sound capacity, 89 liters of Liquid Silence is equivalent to one ton of TNT. Stored within the Smiler Canister pocket dimension, this immense explosive power is quite portable and presents a serious danger.</p><br><p>Liquid Silence is an <em>extremely</em> hard to acquire substance. It can only be harvested from a destroyed Scream Eaters, which merely killing is a task in itself. Scream Eaters are also rare entities themselves, and a single Scream Eater contains only 40 - 50 liters of Liquid Silence. Coupled with its innate unique and useful properties, Liquid Silence is an expensive product that is almost never traded in its liquid form amongst minor groups or people. Only large groups or ones with far reaching influence can access pure Liquid Silence, and often create products utilising it, which are later traded to the general population across the Backrooms.</p><br><p>The author of this article is <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/atom-rutherford\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6877920); return false;\"><img alt=\"Atom_Rutherford\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=6877920&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334082\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=6877920)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/atom-rutherford\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6877920); return false;\">Atom_Rutherford</a></span>.</p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/object-16\">Object 16</a> | Object 17 | <a href=\"/object-18\">Object 18</a> \u00bb</p><br>",

She was right- <em>is</em> right. The M.E.G. just\u2026 they want to help people. Or, at least I think they do \u2014 but that's besides the point. Their issue is that they don't know *what* to do, not at all. This place isn't much better to be honest, but they have the impetus. They want to actually help, to help us survive above everything else. I can also help make them better, hell, I'm the General now, with a capital 'G'! I'm second in command, so if I someone was to help people, I've got the power to do it!

Agent/Civillian under Clearance Level 4. Attempting such an action will result in swift punishment, the severity of which is decided by the Scales of Themis according to the gravity of the offence.</p><br><p>The article below is a brief description of solely The Tears of Achlys. This means that information regarding where exactly it is stored and how it is to be utilized is not included with the information present in this document. Despite this, the omitted information can still be obtained through the teaching of an approved supervisor, which can be requested by personnel with the sufficient clearance (i.e you, the recipient of this document, if you are indeed the one who was intended to receive it). For conciseness, this means that for all intents and purposes, the attached description is meant simply to be a reminder of Achlys' physical properties.</p><br><p>The Tears of Achlys are, under no pretext, to be used as a weapon lest the situation is dire enough to call for their use, and only when the threat is verifiably human. This object is not to be used upon first contact unless the situation in a station is in crisis.</p><br><p><strong>Object ID</strong>: 20216</p><br><p><strong>Name</strong>: \u201cThe Tears of Achlys\u201d - Nickname \u201cAchlys\u201d</p><br><p><strong>Use Clearance</strong>: Level 4</p><br><p><strong>Intended Usage</strong>: Disposal</p><br><p><strong>Object Description</strong>:<br/>\nThe Tears of Achlys (referred to simply as Achlys for brevity) is the name given to a chemical solution used in vital non-entity hostile situations. It can be found only in a liquid or gaseous state, as no solid instances of the object have been synthesized yet.</p><br><p>In its liquid form, Achlys is a semi-transparent, brown, water-based solution. It has a Ph level of 2, which means that it is acidic in nature. The solution is harmless in this form, save for when it makes contact with bare skin or if it is ingested, at which point its volatile effects are felt. When Achlys is dispersed via nozzle, it turns into a gaseous mist, which has highly potent and hazardous qualities. Achyls gas has the anomalous quality to both detect heat and move towards it. This volatile effect makes it more nocent, and makes victims more likely to be affected by its effects than they would be if it was close to them in its liquid form. The reason as to why Achyls turns into a gas only when dispersed through a nozzle is thus far unknown.</p><br><p>The heat-detection of Achlys is derived from unit EN-06's ability to spread itself via bodily fluids, however, Achlys gas is more potent than the entity's own viscera.</p><br><p><strong>Postscript</strong>: A message from Marshal McNamera</p><br><p>If you\u2019re reading this, then you\u2019re going to use this weapon. The moral thing for me to say is that it's a terrible idea and that you shouldn\u2019t, but we\u2019ve crossed that line far ago, haven't we? This object's very inception has left a trail of blood dripping behind it, and it shall continue to do so now that it is in our clutches. Blood into blood - I suppose that's why red was a perfect fit to don on our uniforms.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur history is shrouded in mystery as much as it is shrouded in blood. This sense of unknowing is not one that was adopted with the passage of time, but rather, one that was purposefully manufactured to keep thousands of watchful eyes veiled under the guise of a greater good. Ideally, you would never have that veil lifted off your head - truth be told, it would be preferable to not know what lies behind it. But it's too late to back out of this now.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe usage of Achlys that has been permitted to you is seldom given to anyone, and even now it is tentative. Your judgement may not be as iron clad as you think it is, and you are well aware that you may cause unnecessary harm to others when proceeding with what you have requested of us - hell, I say this as if you don't intend to cause harm, but what other reasons are there to justify this thing's use?<br/>\n<br/>\nI digress however. All I can recommend is to stay vigilant in what you do, and as inhumane as it sounds, stay apathetic during it. It's best if you believe you're in the right in situations like this - it's the only way some of us can sleep at night.<br/>\n<br/>\nMay their hands guide us.<br/>\n<br/>\n-McNamera</p><br><p>A digital re-creation of what Rixa Gas may look like in motion.</p><br><p>Rixa gas is an extremely dangerous bioweapon which has seen common usage by <a href=\"/the-u-e-c\">The Unbound</a> in warfare with other groups. The gas is light and red, comparable to carbon monoxide in its consistency, and spreads across a given medium in tendril-like patterns towards the location of nearby sources of relative heat to its surroundings. The synthesizing of Rixa Gas is, as of now, poorly understood, but unreliable accounts state that the gas is a mixture of sludge from <a href=\"/entity-15\">Entity 15</a> and an unknown solvent (theorized to be either <a href=\"/object-44\">Cashew Water</a> or <a href=\"/object-48\">Liquid Pain</a>). Thus far, no natural deposits of Rixa gas have been found throughout The Backrooms, but its creation/harvesting is attributed to the U.E.C. due to the fact that they are the group known to utilize it the most.</p><br><p>The properties of Rixa gas manifest themselves when it is inhaled. Immediately upon inhalation, the victim will fall to the Wretched Cycle at a rate much more rapid than that caused by Entity 15's regular bodily fluids, with a full transformation occurring within fifty seconds of exposure. Known reactions to the gas during this period of transformation include rapid muscle tissue loss, the flaking of the skin (up to the papilary layer in the dermis), and the rapid loss of blood from bodily orifices. Rixa Gas' effects on entities is unknown, as all recorded uses of the gas have been on humans.</p><br><p>As of the writing of this document, there has only been one survivor of a Rixa Gas attack. A record of their account has been attached to this document for posterity.</p><br><p>An Interview of the Survivor<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup> and Mx.

If the gathering of information means we have to harm someone's wellbeing, then that person's health takes priority over the information we would gain from it. We don't want for you to have to relive any of the day's events after all.</p><br><p>Survivor: Ah, no, it's- it's alright, I'm just glad I have the option. Just need to talk about this, possibly save a few people's lives when- I mean, in the process.

I'll be taking notes whilst you're speaking.</p><br><p>Survivor: It's alright. Well, I guess on that day, the expedition we were assigned to was supposed to be a small scouting mission. <a href=\"/level-76\">Level 76</a>. The team and I had just dropped in from <a href=\"/level-7\">Level 7</a>, but like, we immediately knew there was an\u2026 issue. With the level, I mean.</p><br><p>Vivace: Issue?</p><br><p>Survivor: Wretches. Tons of them. From all the reports of the place, there should\u2019ve only been those weird spider things or whatever. But there they were.</p><br><p>Vivace: Did you notice anything about these Wretches?</p><br><p>Survivor: Oh, most definitely. They were not as smart as most people are used to them being, y'know? Those things are supposed to get smarter in groups, but uh, that wasn't\u2026 wasn't happening here. They were all basically just sitting ducks - didn't even realize we'd notched a few arrows in our bows until they had about ten of them in their guts.</p><br><p>Vivace: That's\u2026 peculiar. Would you say that - besides the presence of Wretches, obviously - there was anything strange about the level leading up to the sewer hub?</p><br><p>Survivor: Nah.</p><br><p>[There is a pause.]</p><br><p>Vivace: Alright, I guess this is where the\u2026 heavier stuff comes in. Do you still wish to go through with this, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588?</p><br><p>Survivor: I\u2026Yeah, I do.</p><br><p>Vivace: Right then, you may continue.</p><br><p>Survivor: Okay, so, I'd say we were around\u2026 two hundred-ish meters away from the hub, when these guys show up. They had gas masks on, bodies covered fully in hazmat suits. Don't- don't ask me where they got them. They had these cans, like bug spray. Like, you know them, those pesticide bottles with the tube and the spitter thing? One of those in each of their hands. There were\u2026 three of them, I think. My memory's not good with those kinda details.</p><br><p>[Interviewee pauses for a second.]</p><br><p>Vivace: \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588?</p><br><p>Survivor: Yeah, I'm fine, just need to\u2026 remember something. Right, so, we stop, gesture to say hi, show we're friendly, but they don't return the gesture. They fired that stuff onto us, and it\u2026 it moved so fast. They fled the scene, leaving us there with it, probably cause they knew what it did. I saw the rest of the guys sniff it and suddenly begin wailing, so I covered my- my mouth, trying to keep it out. I was at the rear, I- I had the time to react. The others, they didn't have the time to- didn't even get to react\u2026</p><br><p>Vivace: How fast would you say the substance moved about?</p><br><p>Survivor: Like, a meter a second. It looked like it was trying to grab us, it had these\u2026tentacles of gas that reached out to us, trying to envelop us. Then the fucking numbness kicked in. I didn\u2019t even feel anything, just\u2026 warmth. Warmth and numbness. Heh, I didn\u2019t even realize my skin was peeling off until I heard the shots. God, I hope my team was numb when the shots went off\u2026</p><br><p>Vivace: \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Are you alright-</p><br><p>Survivor: Why? Why did I run?

    "description": "<p><strong>Wi-Fi</strong>, which is short for wireless fidelity, is a wireless networking technology that allows electronic devices to connect to the Internet. It is unknown how it is obtainable or who is operating the network in The Backrooms, as all attempts to trace the physical location of any router or provider have proven negative. <strong>Wi-Fi</strong> appears to be stronger on some Levels, most of which have windows with an outside visible. The closer you stand to any window, the more powerful the <strong>Wi-Fi</strong> connection is. Normally, <strong>Wi-Fi</strong> networks can only be used to access an intranet, however, recent discoveries have reported that networks outside The Backrooms can be communicated with. This is still being analyzed.</p><br><p><strong>Wi-Fi</strong> is somewhat strange in terms of router names, which all relate to their Level is some ways. On Level 0, the most notable Wi-Fi access point is named \"K38Suh9FH98mBKR\", in which the BKR is noted as an abbreviation of The Backrooms. There is typically no password on any of the <strong>Wi-Fi</strong> networks, and they all cut off at random. The less stable a Level is, the more likely the <strong>Wi-Fi</strong> may cut off at random.</p><br><p>Currently, The Backrooms has a multitude of platforms hosted on its network. The most notable one is listed below:</p><br><p>The M.E.G. Database is widely acknowledged as the most reliable Database for accessing any data revolving around the Levels, Entities, and other anomalies of The Backrooms. It is accessible through any medium which can hold <strong>Wi-Fi</strong> and hold browsers, and gets updated frequently whenever any new data comes forth. Throughout The M.E.G. Database, there are numerous entries which have denied access, due to the data of these entries not being complete as of yet.</p><br><p>While the <strong>Wi-Fi</strong> in The Backrooms have been used before to mysteriously communicate with networks residing in the outside world, this is typically advised against. Since there is no current way to prove the existence of The Backrooms to the outside world, and escape back into The Frontrooms is currently impossible, attempts at communication are futile. Most use it to say goodbye to loved ones lacking a way to explain why they are gone forever.</p><br><p>Due to the way time flows in The Backrooms, it is possible to communicate with those from the past and present simultaneously (Though this does not cause any paradoxes for reasons unclear). This has led to the theory that if an escape from The Backrooms is ever found, the people trapped would likely return at the exact moment they no-clipped out of reality, as if nothing ever happened. However, this cannot be proven.</p><br><p>A generic goodbye message to send to loved ones in The Frontrooms is listed below, and can be used at your discretion.</p><br><p>Hello, <strong>(name)</strong>.

Each scramble has been seen to be different and always extremely difficult to solve. Consequential Cubes have the appearance of being heavily used and being old in all sightings. These cubes can be seen on indoor levels or rarely on outdoor levels. Consequential Cubes produce an odor similar to a stale pizza or a children's birthday party. No matter how much it is cleaned, it always has this scent.</p><br><p>When picked up, it will cause the person who had picked up the Consequential Cube to freeze in place until the wanderer solves the cube. However, the Consequential Cube will only be able to be interacted with by the person who made contact with it. Any other individual's hand that is attempting to interact with the cube has been seen to phase through it. This is the same for the user's body as well.</p><br><p>Although, if picked up by anything without human skin, it can be safely contained within a container and used in a different location of the wanderer's choosing.</p><br><p>Depending on the colored side that gets solved first, it can reward or punish the person solving it. It appears that each color is consistent with whether it is a bad consequence or a reward. However, the outcomes are randomized and are completely different for each solution. Although, the outcomes cycle through a list of different outcomes according to the color.<br/>\nThe list below states each color and each outcome it has. All of these effects can be avoided if the wanderer has prior knowledge of solving Rubik's Cubes. If solved completely, all effects will be reverted and the user will be teleported to a random level.</p><br><p><strong>This side is primarily associated with the most lethal or negatively affecting outcomes.</strong></p><br><p><strong>Bone Randomization</strong><br/>\nAll or most bones within the user's body will shift to an unknown location.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup><br/>\n<strong>Blindness</strong><br/>\nThis causes the user to become legally blind.<br/>\n<strong>Life-Threatening Teleportation</strong><br/>\nThis causes the user to teleport to a level infested with entities or to a level that is almost impossible to survive.<br/>\n<strong>Paralysis</strong><br/>\nThis causes the user to become paralyzed from the waist down.</p><br><p><strong>This side attributes to similar outcomes to the Red Side although the consequences aren't as dreadful.</strong></p><br><p><strong>Teleportation</strong><br/>\nTeleports the user back to <a href=\"/level-0\">Level 0</a>.<br/>\n<strong>Lost Items</strong><br/>\nThis causes half of the user's items to anomalously to vanish to their original places in their founding level.<br/>\n<strong>Walking impairment</strong><br/>\nThis causes the user to have extreme difficulty balancing and walking.<br/>\n<strong>Vertigo</strong><br/>\nThis gives the user vertigo.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup><br/>\n<strong>Cross-eyed</strong><br/>\nThis makes the user's eyes cross, causing visual impairment.</p><br><p><strong>This color attributes to the mild outcomes out of the worst.</strong></p><br><p><strong>This attributes to more neutral outcomes.

    "title": "Object 24 - \"Wall Masks\"",
    "description": "<p><strong>Wall Masks</strong> are theatrical masks that are generally found stuck on the walls of certain Levels, the most significant being <a href=\"/level-0\">Level 0</a>, <a href=\"/level-68\">Level 68</a>, <a href=\"/level-74\">Level 74</a>, and <a href=\"/level-177\">Level 177</a><sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup>. These masks come in various designs, and despite how small or large a mask is at first sight, upon wearing it will conform to fit the face of the wanderer.</p><br><p>Often, a wanderer will find these masks bolted to the wall, requiring a tool to remove it. Conversely, some can be found on the floor, usually paired with the carcass of a wanderer. However, albeit rare, they may also be found randomly spotted on the chairs or floors of various Levels by themselves. There are many types of masks - and one may find quite a few grouped together - yet, depending on a wanderer's mindset, they can only feel drawn to or away from one of them. Once worn, the wanderer will have a sudden urge to go out and kill, whether it be other explorers or entities.</p><br><p>There are multiple variants of <strong>Wall Masks</strong> that cater to a wanderer's personality. A wanderer may only resist the urge to put a <strong>Wall Mask</strong> on if they drink <a href=\"/object-1\">Almond Water</a> upon sight. As such, the following variants are marked based on a wanderer's ability to hide or \"mask\" their true personalities.</p><br><p><strong>Colombina Mask</strong>: One of the most visually appealing mask types, Colombina Masks cover half of a wanderer's face and are very elegant and colorful. Those who wear this mask will hardly act any different than how they normally act but will tend to be more secretive than they already are. Wanderers who wear it kill more stealthily, usually targeting the victims when alone, and attempt to discard the body when human.</p><br><p><strong>Bauta Mask</strong>: Bauta Masks lack a mouth area and are in a rectangular shape, mostly in one base color and covered in swirls. Wanderers who wear this mask become somewhat aggressive and will refuse to talk about the issue when asked. Frequently, Bauta Mask wearers have the tendency to use blunt force in attempts to murder the victim.</p><br><p><strong>Pantalone Mask</strong>: This mask features a sizeable hook nose similar to that of a beak, which covers half the face and bears slanted eyes. Wanderers who put this mask on will act suspiciously and despite their very forceful attempts at seeming normal, their changes in personality are extremely distinct. Pantalone Mask wearers will spout many facts about the Backrooms in attempts to drive a wanderer's mind away from them. When questioned, they are overcome with paranoia and will attempt to escape the conversation. Should they be followed, the wanderer will try to kill said follower. As such, it is recommended that one should let the Pantalone Mask wearer leave.</p><br><p>Note: According to the results of experiments run by the <a href=\"/the-m-e-g\">M.E.G.</a>, explorers with Outstanding Masks seem to put on the mask by choice, rather than simply being physically or mentally forced to by the object alone - despite the fact that they have every ability to refuse.</p><br><p><span style=\"color: grey\">Experiments? Conducted by <a href=\"/the-m-e-g\">the M.E.G.</a>? They're putting innocent wanderers' lives on the line to gain knowledge? Why? I thought we were trying to reduce as many casualties as possible. That's what she told me, that's what <a href=\"/entity-173\">Catelyn</a> told me\u2026 They aren't trying to learn things about these masks, no\u2026 They're using it to obtain people's secrets. This isn't the group I worked for. It couldn't be. Could it?</span></p><br><p><strong>Volto Mask</strong>: Volto Masks have a white base that covers the entire face and is usually covered in gold swirls. When worn, explorers will seem more deceitful and suspicious, but will still overall act like their normal selves. Those who wear it are just as stealthy as Colombina Mask wearers but do not hide the victim's body.</p><br><p><strong>Kitsune<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')\">3</a></sup> Mask</strong>: Kitsune Masks are beautiful, colorful masks of a fox, which usually covers about half of a wanderer's face. When worn, explorers become increasingly sneaky and almost mischievous, often flirtatious but reticent when asked about something personal. Kitsune Mask wearers will lure their victims to their death and are quick with their kills.</p><br><p><strong>Arlecchino Mask</strong>: Arlecchino (or Harlequin) Masks are colorful, normally with a short nose and arched brows. Rarely, the mask includes a large headpiece and/or collar, paired with bells. Those who put this mask on become incredibly giggly at random times, more often than not unable to explain their amusement. Arlecchino Mask wearers will make brash, out of place decisions, constantly coming up with various excuses for their actions. Their way of killing is peculiar - they will walk up to a wanderer, alone, and tell them a joke. If they fail to react to the Arlecchino Mask wearer's satisfaction, they are killed.</p><br><p>Note: These wanderers can still take these masks off, however, they will need a substantial amount of willpower to resist their effect on them.</p><br><p><strong>Buskin<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-4\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')\">4</a></sup> Mask</strong>: This mask has a white base, with black sockets and a dramatized frown. Besides whatever personality an explorer has, they become irritable, impatient, and very prone to complaining. Buskin Mask wearers are a bit more violent and less clean with their kills than Colombina and Volto Mask wearers.</p><br><p><strong>Oni Mask</strong>: These masks represent that of a Japanese demon, known for its acts of evil and kindness. Wanderers who wear it gain a very strong sense of opinion (lest they already did prior to putting the mask on) and don't seem to be afraid of stating their view on certain things. Oni Mask wearers seem to target those who did more wrong than good, and when caught alone, will be killed whilst being yelled at by the Oni Mask wearer.</p><br><p><strong>Sock<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-5\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')\">5</a></sup> Mask</strong>: The most dangerous mask, represents a design similar to the Buskin Mask, with the only noticeable difference is that the frown has been turned upside down. Should a wanderer encounter one wearing this mask, they are to be <strong><em>avoided at all costs.</em></strong> They become extremely wild and violent, and derive pleasure and entertainment from hurting and killing other explorers and entities alike. They target any wanderer who doesn't smile or laugh within sight range. Their kill methods are messy and can be found laughing hysterically as they do an explorer in.</p><br><p><span style=\"color: grey\">What is happening? They told us we would be fine, that we had the people, the weapons, we would be <em>okay</em>. Now they're using these masks as\u2026 a way to add up the numbers? We've seen these mask-wearing sickos in action, they've killed our own\u2026 Do they not realize the more they allow this to happen the more people will die?</span></p><br><p>There are three known ways of ceasing the attacks of any <strong>Wall Mask</strong> wearer, but be wary that these methods will depend on a wanderer's physical strength, caution, and alertness.</p><br><p><strong>Method 1</strong>: Attempt to convince the wearer to take it off on their own. This method is recommended only for wearers with outstanding to basic masks. Choose your words carefully and be mindful of anything that could set the wearer off. With luck, they will take it off and the effects of the mask will wear off.</p><br><p><span style=\"color: grey\">They said the same thing to me. They said the same thing to my sister. They're lying.</span></p><br><p><strong>Method 2</strong>: Forcefully remove the mask from a wearer's face. This may be a difficult task, so take caution when attempting this. This method is recommended for wearers with basic mask to no masks.</p><br><p><span style=\"color: grey\">They told me \"No Masks\" were okay to try this second method on\u2026 tell that to my left hand.</span></p><br><p><strong>Method 3</strong>: Terminate the wearer. This method is recommended for wearers with no masks as well. There will be times in which there is no persuading these wearers, as at some point they will lose the ability to comprehend any thought other than \"Kill.\" At this point, eliminate them through any means necessary.</p><br><p><span style=\"color: grey\">I loved you. I believed you. You told me that the masks were temporary. But now that my untapped strength was dipped into, you want me to keep it on for good. You liar. Liar.

    "description": "<p>Three sticks of Babel Balm without their lids.</p><br><p>Babel Balm is a substance that can be found in small, unlabeled, red capsules akin to standard sticks of lip balm.</p><br><p>The capsules can be anywhere from 4 to 8 centimeters in length and do not exceed 2 centimeters in width. Babel Balm capsules are found most commonly on the floor in <a href=\"/level-0\">Level 0</a>, <a href=\"/level-3\">Level 3</a>, <a href=\"/level-4\">Level 4</a>, and <a href=\"/level-11\">Level 11</a>.</p><br><p>The substance held within the capsules is slightly opaque and white in color, and has a consistency similar to that of standard lip balm. It also releases a small amount of visible light, allowing it to be seen in the dark but not to significantly illuminate its surroundings.</p><br><p>If applied to or near the lips, Babel Balm allows users to be understood by anyone that can hear their voice, regardless of language barriers. Listeners will hear their native language being spoken by the user and the lip movements of the user will appear to match the language the listener perceives. However, this effect does not allow the user to understand what is said to them by listeners who have not applied Babel Balm, so proper conversation requires applications to multiple people.</p><br><p>Alternatively, if Babel Balm is applied to physical text, the text will be legible to any potential readers. This only applies to written/printed text and will not work with digital mediums.</p><br><p>The duration of Babel Balm's effects varies depending on how well it is applied. Informal tests conducted in multilingual outposts seem to indicate that Babel Balm can last anywhere from 10 minutes to 2 hours.</p><br><p>Babel Balm also acts like regular lip balm and can be used to moisturize chapped lips. Users claim the balm has a taste similar to that of Chapstick's original flavor.</p><br><p>The full extent of Babel Balm's uses has yet to be explored, but it is regularly used for communication in outposts. Packs of explorers usually have a Babel Balm supply used for trading at outposts and for when new wanderers noclip into The Backrooms.</p><br><p>Babel Balm is also used by wanderers who find discarded journal pages written in other languages, and you can expect signs and documents in outposts to come equipped with sticks of Babel Balm for easy reading.</p><br><p>M.E.G. members have wondered if Babel Balm could be used to communicate with entities, namely <a href=\"/entity-6\">Dullers</a>, <a href=\"/entity-9\">Facelings</a>, and <a href=\"/entity-3\">Smilers</a>. However, no one has found a safe and effective manner of applying Babel Balm to any of these entities. Because many entities lack lips, it is suspected that Babel Balm would not work on them in the first place, although some M.E.G. members are still curious.</p><br><p>The M.E.G. has conducted several tests with Babel Balm in order to get a grasp of its full capabilities. A log of these tests and the results that ensued is shown below. Please note that any experiments conducted with Babel Balm without the advice and consent of The M.E.G. are not recorded and any supposed results from those experiments have not been verified.</p><br><p>The M.E.G. plans to further test Babel Balm's capabilities in the near future, specifically with regard to its effects on entities.</p><br><p>Written by CosmicCrowMC<br/>\n<span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/cosmiccrowmc\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7343039); return false;\"><img alt=\"CosmicCrowMC\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7343039&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334085\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7343039)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/cosmiccrowmc\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7343039); return false;\">CosmicCrowMC</a></span><br/>\nImage Credit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/13218647@N00/3817149545\" target=\"_blank\">Lippenpflegestift - Lip balm</a><br/>\n\"Lippenpflegestift - Lip balm\" by ds-foto :: bembelkandidat is licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0</p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/object-24\">Object 24</a> | Object 25 | <a href=\"/object-26\">Object 26</a> \u00bb</p><br>",

    "description": "<p><strong>Umi's Sweets</strong> can be only obtained by knocking on any door on <a href=\"/level-9\">Level 9</a> and after waiting exactly eight seconds a serpentine entity called Mummy Umi will open the door and confront the individual.</p><br><p>Its presence induces extreme hysteria in all individuals within 70 meters frequently prompting them to scream. Once any sound is made either by the individual or any external source, an intensely bright light is discharged, identical to the light emitted from the <a href=\"/entity-96\">watchers</a>, but with a much larger area (50 meters in diameter) turning all wanderers present to dust. If a person succeeds in remaining completely silent, the entity will hand out some <strong>Umi's Sweets</strong> to them and disappear. Some theorize that Mummy Umi is comprised of pure, solid <a href=\"/object-17\">liquid silence</a> due to its vanta-black color and fear-inducing property. Some go even further to say that Mummy Umi is a special type of <a href=\"/entity-97\">scream eater</a>, but of course, none of this is confirmed.</p><br><p>Apart from being a constant height of 2.3 meters, Mummy Umi has various forms and every encounter greatly differs from one person to the next. Wanderers have reported that some forms of the entity are much more terrifying than others, and it is said that the rarity and quantity of sweets offered is dependent on how frightening the form is. It also seems that Umi has a special affinity for children less than 13 as it takes on tamer forms in their presence. Sometimes when children make sounds, instead of instantly executing them, Mummy Umi will only become agitated or will quickly shut the door.</p><br><p><iframe allowtransparency=\"true\" class=\"html-block-iframe\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"/object-27/html/90f10820d04d2a715d6c4eed0bf7cb0b66d76b31-1346903770194240779\"></iframe></p><br><p>There are a variety of <strong>Umi's Sweets</strong>. most are valuable with useful qualities, making them highly desired and traded for in the backrooms while some have disastrous effects and should be avoided entirely.</p><br><p>Pumpkin Paprika Puffs can be traded for a bottle of Almond Water.</p><br><p>The most common and probably most enjoyed candy. This sweet resembles macarons, a popular snack in <a href=\"/the-frontrooms\">the Frontrooms</a>, but much smaller. Pumpkin Puffs have no negative effects but are described to have a powerful pleasing taste nearing euphoria. They are known for their mildly sweet but spicy taste; they are always warm to the touch and never spoil, staying fresh and hot for months.

When lightly heated (40<sup>o</sup>C), they expand to such an extent that a single bead of Almond Sugar will create at least five liters of <a href=\"/object-1\">Almond Water</a>. Since they are extremely rare and invaluable, Almond Sugars are only seen amongst large groups who use them as a more efficient way of storing gallons worth of <a href=\"/object-1\">Almond Water</a>.

However, they are only viable in small quantities, any more than ten grams will cause sudden weakness and fatigue that lasts for up to three hours, and more than twenty grams causes permanent confusion causing victims to slowly turn into a <a href=\"/entity-15\">Wretch</a> later on.

The yellow luck flavor is worth 15 kilograms of Firesalt.</p><br><p>Lucky bars are long flat bars of what seems to be hardened <a href=\"/object-28\">Lucky O' milk</a> of various flavors. While most of the common flavors of Lucky Bars such as plain, strawberry, and Chocolate have less of an effect than their liquid counterpart, the luck flavor is more potent and much rarer. Though the luck flavor has the same bright yellow hue and distinct banana scent as in the drink, once its wrapper is removed, its solid form progressively liquifies into a sticky semi-solid before quickly forming a soft custard-like gel. The harder the Lucky Bar is, the luckier the individual becomes; however, this effect turns into bad luck once the Lucky Bar becomes soft enough to be chewed. luck gained from the candy is usually in the form of finding useful items and resources or even escaping entities or situations one would not normally escape from. Bad luck on the other hand is associated with random no-<br/>\nclips to very dangerous levels, hoards of hostile entities appearing from nowhere, and bottles of <a href=\"/object-1\">Almond Water</a> suddenly turning into <a href=\"/object-44\">Cashew Water</a> or <a href=\"/object-48\">Liquid Pain</a>.

    "title": "Object 28 - \u201cLucky O\u2019 Milk\u201d",
    "description": "<p><strong>Lucky O\u2019 Milk</strong> is again, a soybean-based drink that is a great substitute to <strong>Almond Water</strong>, for people who have nut allergies. The bottles are made up of a tough, clear, colourless glass, similar to those old fashion milk bottles. It looks like the label, which is around the midsection, has been ingrained into to the glass and is tinted compared to the rest of the bottle. There are 6 flavours corresponding to 5 different labels, with each flavour having its own effect. Theres even an ingredients list on the back of the label where information is as listed:</p><br><p>Soybeans 100%<br/>\nSugars 0%<br/>\nNatural preservatives: 300%<br/>\nArtificial Flavourings/Colourings: 0%</p><br><p>It seems to be a very bastardized version of a food label, making no attempt to talk about the calorie count, serving size, carbs or anything besides what it lists. I would say this bottle is about half a quart or maybe 20 fl ounces with the experience I have in bottle packaging. Though it does mention containing a high amount of calcium, I think this might be one of the healthiest things available to drink in the Backrooms.</p><br><p>As mentioned before, each colour corresponds with a unique label for the 6 flavours except for two, whose labels look exactly the same. Now, the label has the name of the flavour ingrained into it, making it easy to identify what flavour of Lucky O\u2019 Milk you have. But the cap is also an identifier sporting its own unique little logos, ie. a small drawing of chocolate for the chocolate flavour. The only exception being the <strong>Luck</strong> and <strong>Banana</strong> flavours, with neither having a little logo sticker on it\u2019s cap or a flavour ingrained onto the label. Meaning <strong>Luck</strong> flavour is highly situational and can be dangerous if not properly identified and dealt with.</p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n[<strong>Loading audio log\u2026</strong>]</p><br><p>[<strong>start log</strong>]</p><br><p><strong>Nicky</strong>: -Esting, testing, testing. Alright, since Stan and Arthur are out on another mission, I\u2019m doing this solo.</p><br><p>[<strong>Audible machinery</strong>]</p><br><p><strong>Nicky</strong>: So the milk comes from these fun little gachapon machines. They\u2019re everywhere on level 4, and are served cold too. Pretty cool, I\u2019m lovin the vibes. They don't require any money, and are plugged into the wall without an outlet. Shit\u2019s crazy I tell ya.</p><br><p>[<strong>Muffled bottle opening and drinking noise</strong>]</p><br><p><strong>Nicky</strong>: Mmm, hey now this is pretty damn good, it\u2019s just like chocolate milk, and it\u2019s made entirely out of soybeans? Though, it\u2019s kinda strange it\u2019s just- purple? Eh more like violet. Let\u2019s see, nutritional value\u2026 no sugar, no artificial flavourings, 100% soybeans. Damn, it sounds like they just stuffed <em>Jack and The Bean Stalk</em> into a bottle, and\u2026 it\u2019s high in calcium too? Haha, looks like I got the easiest objective.</p><br><p>[<strong>More audible machinery</strong>]</p><br><p><strong>Nicky</strong>: Huh. This ones yellow\u2026 is that it? What kind of flavour is yellow?? Where\u2019s the fuckin\u2019 flavour on the label?? Theres no cute little sticker on the lid either what the shit- uh what or whoever made these things. How am I supposed to know if it\u2019s lemonade or banana? Tch, only one way to find out I guess-</p><br><p>[<strong>Audible drinking noise</strong>]</p><br><p><strong>Nicky</strong>: Fucking hell\u2014 <em>cough</em>, <em>cough fuckme</em> that is some strong sHI-</p><br><p>[<strong>Loud Thump</strong>]</p><br><p><strong>Nicky</strong>: [<strong>Intelligible screaming and yelling along with audible profanity</strong>] Huff\u2026 <em>huff</em>, heh\u2026 <em>\u201cEasiest objective\u201d</em> my ass\u2026</p><br><p>[<strong>Several minutes pass by with only audible panting and occasional swearing</strong>]</p><br><p><strong>Nicky</strong>: Alright, I think, I just might be able to get up. <em>Huff</em>. Come on\u2026 <em>Up</em>, you fuckin clutz.</p><br><p>[<strong>Shuffling of the audio recorder being picked up and footsteps</strong>]</p><br><p><strong>Nicky</strong>: Alright\u2026 Come on, <em>huff</em>, just need to get back to the M.E.- what the\u2014 <em>FUCK</em>-</p><br><p>[ <em>Nicky Oswald reportedly clips through the floor of <a href=\"/level-4\">Level 4</a>, and ends up in \u201c<strong><a href=\"/level-276\">Level 276</a></strong>,\u201d the next three hours are cut as they are filled with screaming and footsteps. In the end, he managed to escape and met up with M.E.G agents Diana Hylius and Ray Thousand in \u201c<strong><a href=\"/level-601\">The End</a></strong>.\u201d It was discovered that the yellow flavour he had consumed was Luck, and since the machine served the milk cold, he had unbelievably bad luck for the next 3 to 4 hours, thus causing him to clip into The Hive without any explanation or proper entry point. The injuries sustained right after consumption were as follows. Right hand had been broken in 3 different places. Twisted and sprained ankles from dropping into The Hive. Several scrapes and bruises on hands, feet, face, and arms gained from running and hiding from hounds, death moths, etc. for three hours straight.</em> ]</p><br><p>[<strong>end log.</strong>]</p><br><p>Due to the fact Banana and Luck flavour are so similar, it is <strong>highly</strong> recommended to heat up any/all yellow bottles to about 71 degrees Celsius at a minimum before consumption. As stated previously. Neither have the flavours on the label.</p><br><p><strong>Lucky O\u2019 Milk</strong> has lots of useful effects that are given on consumption. To use them to the fullest, follow the instructions below. (Note that you can still drink them just for hydration alone.)</p><br><p><strong>For a More Restful Sleep</strong>:<br/>\nPour out some Matcha flavour onto a paper towel, and slowly dab it under your eyes, the bridge of your nose, and under the ears. This helps to relieve strain on the eyes, eardrums, and unclogs the nose for a better sleeping experience.</p><br><p><strong>Joint Pain and Muscle Reliever</strong>:<br/>\nPaper towels will be your friend here, though any cloth/linen/sheet will do. Dampen whatever you have with the Chocolate flavour milk and lay it on the area you wish to relieve. Now this may sound gross and very sticky, but the end result is that all pain, soreness, and stiffness in the area is gone, and is left dry and strangely tinted violet for a short amount of time. It\u2019s almost as if it was absorbed completely.</p><br><p><strong>Soy Milk Adderall(BerryMatcha Blast)</strong>:<br/>\nCombining equal parts Strawberry flavour and Matcha flavour in any quantity will result in a D.I.Y liquid Adderall.(Which the top brass decided to universally call \u201cBerryMatcha Blast\u201d. Fuck you.) The effect is practically, and near identical to actual Adderall, though it\u2019s most major difference is there being <strong>NO</strong> risk of addiction. At a certain point past 16 fl ounces the added effect will bottom out, meaning with no negative side effects you get a Strawberry-Matcha fusion that\u2019s like, Coffee\u2019s cooler older brother that everyone likes better. The effects range on how much you drink, about 1 hour to every 4 fl ounces. Oh, and also your skin flashes red and green while drinking it like a video game power-up.</p><br><p><strong>Drink it</strong>:<br/>\nOr if you want a simple way of gaining the effects, just drink them. They\u2019re quite nutritious and besides the \u201cLucky O\u2019 Nicky\u201d incident, there are no other recorded luck-based incidents caused by Lucky O\u2019 Milk. Though, people with soy allergies can\u2019t drink it, as it\u2019s made entirely out of soybeans.</p><br><p><span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/soyshamoy\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7438051); return false;\"><img alt=\"SoyShamoy\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7438051&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1731385854\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7438051)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/soyshamoy\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7438051); return false;\">SoyShamoy</a></span></p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/object-27\">Object 27</a> | Object 28 | <a href=\"/object-29\">Object 29</a> \u00bb</p><br>",

    "title": "Object 29 - \"3D Vision Glasses\"",
    "description": "<p>3D Vision Glasses have the appearance of normal 3D glasses offered in cinemas for viewing of \"3D\" films. They have a thin and boxy frame, as if folded out of a bendy, plastic-like material. The only difference between this object and its <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-frontrooms\">Frontroom</a> counterpart is that the colors of the lenses are swapped, with the right lens being red and the left one being blue. The Glasses come only in one-size-fits-all.</p><br><p>Despite their flimsy appearance, 3D Vision Glasses are surprisingly durable; they are resistant to tearing, snapping, and water. When worn, they remain glued to the wearer's face, ensuring that they stay in place even when running, jumping, or entering water. However, the wearer can easily remove them without resistance.</p><br><p>Wearing 3D Vision Glasses completely replaces one's normal sight with an external perspective view. The wearer looks down at themselves from a mid-high point behind them, akin to the \"3rd person view\" in 21st century video games. Navigating this enhanced vision is similar to normal vision, following the position of the body and rotating with the head and eyes.</p><br><p>The new field of vision is also wider than a human's, allowing the user to have an ample view of their surroundings. Some notable advantages are:</p><br><p>A wanderer with myopia (interview transcript below) reported having completely clear sight while wearing 3D Vision Glasses. It is currently unknown what would happen if a blind person were to wear the Glasses.</p><br><p>3D Vision Glasses are used by some wanderers who have decided to train themselves to expertly navigate the 3rd person view, and are able to utilize its advantages. They train their coordination, proprioception (spatial perception) and their new sense of sight, which may come more naturally and quickly to some.</p><br><p>Advanced <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-m-e-g\">M.E.G.</a> regiments (particularly Rescues and Raids, Frontline Explorers, and Entity Removal,) occasionally make use of 3D Vision Glasses for particularly dangerous expeditions which would benefit from enhanced vision.</p><br><p>Putting on 3D Vision Glasses for the first few times can be very disorienting; inexperienced wearers will feel dizzy, overwhelmed, unbalanced, and even nauseous and hysterical at worst.</p><br><p>Vice-versa, for long-time users of 3D Vision Glasses who constantly live in a 3rd person view perspective, taking the Glasses off also causes dizziness and mild panic. The sheer reduction of sight feels limiting and uncomfortable to wanderers who have grown used to a broader and enhanced field of view.</p><br><p><strong>M.E.G. RECORDING TRANSCRIPT</strong><br/>\n<strong>Selected clip from minute 10:34 to 12:19</strong></p><br><p><strong>&lt;START CLIP&gt;</strong></p><br><p><strong>Sue:</strong> Thank you for giving us an insight on how these glasses work.

You never take them off?</p><br><p><strong>Matthews:</strong> Never. <em>(chuckles.)</em> Why would I choose to downgrade to having a worse vision?

But when I wear these <em>(taps his 3D Glasses)</em> I see as clear as day. Clearer, even!</p><br><p><strong>Sue:</strong> \u2026So not even when you sleep?</p><br><p><strong>Matthews:</strong> No m'am.</p><br><p><em>(The interviewer tentatively reaches her hand towards the 3D Vision Glasses the interviewee is wearing.)</em></p><br><p><strong>Sue:</strong> Would it be possible for me to quickly try them on? To have a first-hand experience.</p><br><p><em>(The interviewee quickly leans away, shaking his head.)</em></p><br><p><strong>Matthews:</strong> No, trust me, that would do us both harm. I already told you about the effects of rapidly switching visions\u2014especially if you're used to your current one.</p><br><p><strong>Sue:</strong> Oh, of course. I'm very intrigued, that's all.</p><br><p><em>(The interviewer sits back in her chair.)</em></p><br><p><strong>Sue:</strong> Are you sure you don't want to lend your 3D Vision Glasses to the M.E.G. for further research? Only for a short period of time, and you would be well compensated\u2014</p><br><p><strong>Matthews:</strong> No sorry, these glasses are a part of me.

    "description": "<p><strong>Greasy Marshmallows</strong> are little fluffy cylinders with a sweet taste and a soft texture. This object seems to be very popular among the wanderers of the Backrooms, as they are useful for gaining energy or simply getting strength as of its effects. When the object has been melted, it has a consistency similar to chocolate syrup or honey.</p><br><p>This food can only be eaten if they are melted. When the marshmallows aren't melted, instead of having positive effects, they will just cause fatigue, and your body will begin to feel heavy as you lose your energy. It's better to melt this object with Almond Water, as it reduces the risk of there being bacteria. The reason is unknown. However, it's thought to be because of a substance they could hypothetically have inside them.</p><br><p>The greasy marshmallows will only be useful if you eat them melted, otherwise they will exhibit their negative properties. It's recommended to always have a melted portion of this object if you're going to do elaborate actions which need a lot of energy or physical strength. Wanderers have preferred to use this object when they have to run away from entities or are rescuing people.</p><br><p>This object can be found in any Level of The Backrooms. However, there are some specific areas of all Levels where there are marshmallows. The likelihood of finding the object depends on the Level. The location where it can be most commonly found is within the kitchen area of Level -599.</p><br><p>This object may be very useful, but after you use it, you can start feeling its side effects, such as headaches, stomachache, bloating and if you eat too much you may experience a heart attack. Consuming around 50-90 of these marshmallows in their melted form can make your skin squishy and soft. You will also get pale, and your body will start to emit a sweet aroma. Eating from 100-110 of these object will make your body feel heavy, and you will start to feel greasy. Your skin will become very soft, and it will become very difficult for you to move.</p><br><p><strong>Begin log</strong> : 12:17 Mid-day.<br/>\n<strong>Unknown wanderer</strong> : \"H- hello..?

    "description": "<p>Object 31 is a charred wooden Ouija Board which has the alphabet, the numbers 0-9, and the words \"YES\", \"NO\", and \"GOODBYE\" marked on it in black paint. Object 31 also contains a similarly charred wooden planchette with the letter \"X\" painted on it. The object was discovered in the basement of a naturally occurring store in <a href=\"/level-11\">Level 11</a> called \"Gifts of the Goddess\". This store seems to mostly contain products pertaining to Occultism and New Age Spirituality. The basement was empty except for Object 31.</p><br><p>Object 31 has the mystical property that if someone places their hand on the planchette, it will begin to move on its own. During this time, the planchette is seemingly controlled by the spirit of someone deceased who the user knew personally. Wanderers can communicate with specific people that they knew personally by thinking about that person before using the object. Attempting to communicate with the spirits of people who the user did not know have been unreliable. Additionally, sessions with the object don't last longer than 10-15 minutes and require at least a few hours for the object to recharge before another use.</p><br><p>Debate is still ongoing as to whether the use of Object 31 should be authorized for wanderers who are grieving, and experiments are planned to determine if use of the object can help with the mourning process or if it would have negative emotional effects on those involved.</p><br><p><strong>Overseeing Personnel:</strong> Zofia Connelly, M.E.G.

    "description": "<p><strong>Reality Fresheners</strong> are devices commonly used by the group \"Backrooms Remodeling Co.\" and appear to affect the nearby reality. When placed and opened, multiple effects will begin. The most notable of these is a mango-like scent that emits from the device. Most importantly, the somewhat \u201cfluid\u201d reality of the Backrooms is halted in a short-range around the device; the short-range explains the use of many of these objects. It is unknown whether this effect is caused by the mango scent or not.</p><br><p>When an entity comes within range of the <strong>Reality Fresheners\u2019</strong> area of effect, it seems to stun the entity, causing it to seem confused and distressed, and walk with some difficulty. This appears to be because entities also do not apply to the rules of reality. This is further proven by the fact that entities that 'make less sense' seem to be even more affected by this.</p><br><p>Objects are affected as well, and any object that does not abide by the rules of reality will either cease to work or work to a lesser degree.</p><br><p>In an attempt to research and analyze the \"Reality Tech\" often used by Backrooms Remodelling Co. a group had been sent from M.E.G. Base Gamma to a nearby location that Backrooms Remodelling Co. Employees have been reported to frequent. This was in the hopes of taking a single <strong>Reality Freshener</strong> from a Backrooms Remodelling Co. Employee. Below is the video log of said mission.</p><br><p><strong>Begin Log:</strong> <em>Time Unavailable</em> 8/17/2021</p><br><p><em>(The log starts out facing a brick wall in <a href=\"/level-3\">Level 3</a>. The camera quickly pans down to M.E.G. Operative Camdon Retz, who is seen making a face with his tongue out. A volunteer M.E.G. Operative hits him on the shoulder lightly, notifying him to stop. The camera is lifted and turned to view around the corner. In the distance a Backrooms Remodelling Co. Employee is seen writing on a clipboard, five (5) <strong>Reality Fresheners</strong> are clipped to its belt. The camera is quickly moved back as the employee looks up.)</em></p><br><p><strong>Retz:</strong> <em>(Retz is heard struggling with the camera as he attaches it to a band on his head.)</em> So what are those things anyway?</p><br><p><strong>Volunteer Operative A:</strong> No idea, some kinda soldiers? What are they doing?</p><br><p><strong>Volunteer Operative B:</strong> \"Remodeling\" apparently, some sort of housing company.</p><br><p><strong>Retz:</strong> <em>(Retz stands and takes a few steps toward the hall with the employee.)</em> You two stay back here, if I call you or something jumps me, come get me. I'm not dying to one of these things.</p><br><p><strong>Volunteer Operative B:</strong> We'll be ready.</p><br><p><strong>Retz:</strong> You'd better. <em>(Retz stands, watching the employee. Apparently waiting for it to turn around. The employee does, and he begins to run quietly down the hallway, staying low to the floor to be as unnoticeable as possible. He reaches the employee and puts a hand on the device. This, however, is noticed by the employee, who turns to Retz in response.)</em></p><br><p><strong>Employee:</strong> Sir? You aren't permitted to have those.</p><br><p><strong>Retz:</strong> <em>(Retz falls back, apparently in surprise. A sound is heard as Retz apparently hits his head on the tile floor.)</em> I- I- Uh-</p><br><p><strong>Employee:</strong> Sir? Are you okay? <em>(Employee begins to approach Retz, who begins crawling backward on the floor.)</em></p><br><p><strong>Retz:</strong> I- I'm fine- I-</p><br><p><strong>Employee:</strong> Do you need some help, sir? <em>(The employee reaches a hand down toward Retz, who moves back farther in response.)</em></p><br><p><em>(In the next few seconds, footsteps are heard as the two volunteer Operatives are heard approaching.)</em></p><br><p><strong>Volunteer Operative A:</strong> <em>(Operative A is seen running in front of Retz holding a knife and threatens the employee with it)</em></p><br><p><strong>Volunteer Operative B:</strong> Holy shit Cam, you're bleeding.</p><br><p><em>(The camera angle begins to tilt sideways and fall toward the floor as Retz begins to pass out due to his head injury. Volunteer Operative A is seen arguing with the employee. It's at this point the camera begins to glitch visually and audibly, apparently shaken when Retz fell to the floor.</em></p><br><p><em>Volunteer Operative A is seen tackling the employee to the floor, and quickly attempting to stab it with the knife, to little reaction from the employee. The knife is seen entering the employee's chest as the visual glitches get worse, and the employee's eyes are seen flickering and dying out, much like lightbulbs, apparently signifying that it is dead.</em></p><br><p><em>The camera shakes and begins to be pulled backward as Retz gets dragged away by Volunteer Operative B. Volunteer Operative A is seen standing above the employee's body when another employee (recognized as Employee \"Cap'n\" upon later viewing) walks up to Volunteer Operative A. Enough of the audio glitches subside to hear most of what is said.)</em></p><br><p><strong>Employee \"Cap'n\":</strong> Hello [Obstructed by audio glitch] can I help you? <em>(Employee \"Cap'n\" looks down at the body of the other Employee, and leans down, grabbing hold of one of the <strong>Reality Freshener</strong> devices and taking it off the body, which is beginning to bleed what looks like black blood or oil.)</em> Is this what you were after sir? Here you go! <em>(\"Cap'n\" places the device into Volunteer Operative A's hand who seems shocked at its reaction to the death of another employee.)</em></p><br><p><strong>End Log:</strong> <em>(Time unavailable)</em></p><br><p><a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/pandashark-s-author-page|\">PandaShark71004</a></p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/object-31\">Object 31</a> | Object 32 | <a href=\"/object-33\">Object 33</a> \u00bb</p><br>",

Their form of self-defense utilizes their sharp claws on all four paws and their canine teeth, both of which are made with solid steel that can pierce through the skin of most entities. They have night vision and excellent hearing, making them very useful for exploring dark areas or avoiding entities.</p><br><p><strong>Cat Robopets</strong> have a starting price of 15 Karma, though the price may differ based on customizations.</p><br><p><strong>Dog RoboPet</strong></p><br><p><strong>Dog RoboPets</strong> are generally designed to be similar to a dog of the Beagle breed. They have folded ears, round eyes, and large noses. They often stand at 1.25 feet tall when on all fours and 2.5 feet tall when on the hind legs, and they weigh around five pounds. They have a large, muscular body, large paws, a long muzzle, and are covered in faux fur to mimic a dog from the Frontrooms.</p><br><p><strong>Dog RoboPets</strong> can run up to 15mph, and can jump up to three feet high. They have a very keen sense of smell and can sense and recognize any entity within a 1-mile radius. Their form of self-defense mostly consists of their sharp teeth, which they can use to injure any common entity. Their sense of smell not only helps them be aware of entities nearby but of fellow people and resources as well, making them a very good companion for exploring.</p><br><p><strong>Dog Robopets</strong> have a starting price of 15 Karma, though the price may differ based on customizations.</p><br><p><strong>Gecko RoboPet</strong></p><br><p><strong>Gecko RoboPets</strong> are generally designed to be similar to a crested gecko. They have 240\u00ba vision, protective scales covering their body, and webbed feet. They are often seven inches long and weigh 50 grams. They have small bodies, short legs, and large tails.</p><br><p><strong>Gecko RoboPets</strong> can run up to 9mph, making them the slowest out of all of the RoboPets. However, Gecko RoboPets are also the smallest, making them easy to carry and hide, and they are also the only RoboPets that can climb walls. They accomplish this using their feet, which have thousands of microscopic hairs that allow them to stick to the wall with ease, making it very easy to scope out small areas and areas you would not be able to reach otherwise. Along with this, Gecko RoboPets can camouflage with any environment using our latest color-matching technology. Their form of self-defense is mostly centered around their claws and teeth. However, they are unable to do significant harm to enemies, and work best as distractions.</p><br><p><strong>Gecko Robopets</strong> have a starting price of 5 Karma, though the price may differ based on customizations.</p><br><p><strong>Hamster RoboPet</strong></p><br><p><strong>Hamster RoboPets</strong> are generally designed to look similar to a hamster of the Syrian breed. They have large front teeth, small paws, and round bodies. They are often 8 inches long and weigh around 5 oz. They have short limbs, large eyes, and rounded ears.</p><br><p><strong>Hamster RoboPets</strong> can run up to 10 miles an hour, and they can run up to 12 miles an hour using their complementary RoboPet ball. Hamster RoboPets are the second smallest RoboPet, making them easy to carry and hide. Their cheeks have similar functionality to the <a href=\"/object-87\">Worn Sack</a>. They can store any item with no capacity limits, as long as the item can fit in their mouth. Their form of self-defense utilizes their large, sharp teeth to bite and injure enemies.</p><br><p><strong>Hamster Robopets</strong> have a starting price of 5 Karma, though the price may differ based on customizations.</p><br><p><strong>Rabbit RoboPet</strong></p><br><p><strong>Rabbit RoboPets</strong> are generally designed to look similar to an Eastern Cottontail rabbit. They have oval-shaped ears, short tails, and large teeth. They are often 1.5 feet tall and weigh three pounds. They have short limbs, round bodies, and a large nose.</p><br><p><strong>Rabbit RoboPets</strong> can run up to 15mph and can jump up to five feet high. Their teeth are made of pure titanium, allowing them to chew their way through any common material found in levels. They can create burrows large enough to hide an average human in 15 minutes! Their form of self-defense utilizes their hind legs to kick or their large teeth to bite their opponent.</p><br><p><strong>Rabbit Robopets</strong> have a starting price of 10 Karma, though the price may differ based on customizations.</p><br><p><strong>RoboPets</strong> are by far the easiest pets to take care of! They don't need to eat or sleep, they just need to be recharged at night using their standard RoboPet charging pad, which has been designed to look like a typical pet bed. RoboPets can be easily trained to do tricks and/or be better fighters, which can be done by doing daily training sessions with them!</p><br><p>Each <strong>RoboPet</strong> also comes with our Robotics Insurance, meaning you will not have to pay for any naturally occurring repairs! These include rusting, wire deterioration, and movement jamming. However, any repairs that do not occur naturally are not covered by Robotics Insurance.</p><br><p>It is important to note that while <strong>RoboPets</strong> are immune to fire, water, and most Backrooms entities, they cannot handle high voltage, short-circuiting at 30 volts. Please keep your RoboPets far away from any sources of electricity that exceed this limit.</p><br><p>Order your <strong>RoboPet</strong> at the Backrooms Robotics website! We'll deliver your <strong>RoboPet</strong> right to your doorstep/droppoint!</p><br><p><a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-33/offset/1\">backroomsrobotics.org</a></p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/object-32\">Object 32</a> | Object 33 | <a href=\"/object-34\">Object 34</a> \u00bb</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/object-33\">Object 33 - \u201cRoboPets\u201d</a>\" by ReyDay, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

    "title": "Object 34 - \"Cassette Recorder\"",
    "description": "<p>The <strong>Cassette Recorder</strong>, also referred to as the <strong>Tape Recorder</strong>, is a somewhat-rare object that can be found most commonly in <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/the-atelier\">The Atelier</a>. It can also be handed out by <a href=\"/entity-137\">Entity 137</a> if he becomes particularly fond of someone or if he sees they are struggling to get through the Backrooms.</p><br><p>Visually, it appears almost completely identical to an <em>Onn.</em> cassette recorder that can be found in the Frontrooms, but with a heightened level of durability. In addition to this, the \u201cRECORD\u201d and \u201cSTOP/EJECT\u201d buttons do not work. It is presumed to help prevent the cassette tape inside from getting removed or overridden. As of now, the only known way to remove the tape is by completely destroying the recorder.</p><br><p>There are currently 4 known variants of music that can be played from them, all of which are identical to the ones that have been heard being played by <a href=\"/entity-137\">Entity 137</a>. To find audio recordings of these songs, view the Audio Logs section of this page.</p><br><p>When in an active state, the music has a sort of \u201carea effect\u201d within 10 feet (3.048 meters) on all sides of it. Much like how <a href=\"/entity-137\">Entity 137</a>\u2019s music works, the majority of aggressive entities will become docile or passive when inside of the area effect\u2019s boundaries. Some entities have been observed to even avoid the boundary altogether. However, it doesn\u2019t work on as many entities as <a href=\"/entity-137\">Entity 137</a>\u2019s music does, so it\u2019s not a 100% foolproof solution against aggressive entities.<br/>\nThe cassette inside will never break, regardless of what happens to the recorder itself. If the cassette is removed and placed inside of a separate tape recorder, it plays the same tunes, but it loses its entity-repellent abilities. It is recommended that wanderers and personnel do not try to remove the cassette tape due to this reason.</p><br><p>The first known sighting of Object 34 was on August 6th, 2001, when Backforums user \u201c@yourmomisgay\u201d posted on the site saying: [sic] \u201cBro, some weird ass tall dude playing music just came up to me, offered me some water, and gave me some tape recorder thing?? Wtf????\u201d They then followed up with a separate post: [sic] \u201cThe music sounds nice at least IG lol,\u201d which was accompanied by a video of them pressing the \u201cPLAY\u201d button and letting the song play.</p><br><p>To use the <strong>Cassette Recorder,</strong> simply press the \u201cPLAY\u201d button to begin the recording.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> The rest of the buttons are quite self-explanatory: \u201cREWIND\u201d quickly reverses the tape to any point that the recording has already passed. \u201cFAST FWD\u201d quickly speeds forwards in the tape. \u201cPAUSE\u201d stops the recording temporarily until you press \u201cPLAY\u201d again. The length of the audio recording varies between cassettes, but they\u2019re generally no shorter than 2 minutes and no longer than 5 minutes.</p><br><p>Research into why the music has the effect it does is currently ongoing, as well as how the tapes are formed and why they only work inside of their original recorders. As of writing, not much information has been found, but there have been many theories. These theories are as follows:</p><br><p>1. <strong>The music has the ability to affect the chemical components of the brain that impact aggression or negative emotions, thus \u201ccalming\u201d the majority of entities within it.</strong><br/>\nThis theory has been partially proven. Experiments have found that most living creatures that are under some form of distress or experiencing any sort of negative emotion calm down at a quicker pace than if they were to calm down on their own. However, whether this is simply a natural result of hearing pleasant music or if it actually has any effect on brain chemicals is currently unknown.</p><br><p>2. <strong>Entities with an extreme level of aggression or that are particularly prone to violence aren\u2019t affected by the music because the music doesn\u2019t change chemical activity within the brain enough to lessen it.</strong><br/>\nThis goes hand-in-hand with the first theory, and many agree it is very likely. However, there is no proof of this as of yet, so it\u2019s still just a theory.</p><br><p>3. <strong>Some entities avoid the cassette recorder because they simply don\u2019t like the music it plays or the way it makes them feel.</strong><br/>\nThis is a much less agreed-on theory, but many still keep it in mind as a possibility for the sake of research.</p><br><p>4. <strong>The cassette recorders have a special mechanism inside of them that activates the anomalous effect of the cassette.</strong><br/>\nAgain, many researchers agree that this is very likely, but there is no proof or evidence to back it up since there is no known way to open the cassette recorders without destroying them almost completely.</p><br><p>There have been several other theories over time, but all of them either were not significant enough to take into account or were completely disregarded as a whole.</p><br><p>As of right now, no clear audio recordings have been acquired. This page will be updated as soon as any are gathered.</p><br><p>~ <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/icecoldlemonade\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7776565); return false;\"><img alt=\"IceColdLemonade\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7776565&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334085\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7776565)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/icecoldlemonade\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7776565); return false;\">IceColdLemonade</a></span></p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/object-33\">Object 33</a> | Object 34 | <a href=\"/object-35\">Object 35</a> \u00bb</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/object-34\">Object 34 - \"Cassette Recorder\"</a>\" by IceColdLemonade, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

These vials cannot be broken with blunt force; they are only able to be opened by removing the opening located at the top of the flask.</p><br><p>The liquid kept inside the vial is a deep, pitch black, which is entirely opaque. The liquid itself has a smell that is reportedly different to each individual who inhales it, though the origin of the scent is currently unknown. Inside of the fluid is a small crystal, which has been documented in six different colors: turquoise blue, purple, ruby red, deep navy blue, white, and black.</p><br><p>The use of these vials was not known<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> until a wanderer confused a vial for healing ointment. The wanderer lathered the black fluid on their injury, which was a deep gash, and they screamed immediately. \"It burnt like hell and I couldn't get it off,\" said the wanderer, and later they passed out from pain. Hours later, when they awoke, their injury was gone and no pain remained in their affected area.</p><br><p>After the event, they agreed for an interview with <a href=\"/the-eternal-repository\">Eternal Repository</a> personnel. The tape was released to the M.E.G. and general public as a foreshadow, should other wanderers find vials.</p><br><p>~-Begin Audio File ERAF:1249/E-~</p><br><p>ER Personnel: Thank you for coming, ma'am. What is your name?</p><br><p>Woman: My name is Elizabeth.</p><br><p>ER Personnel: And mine is Yel. Why did you come to us today?</p><br><p>Elizabeth: I have this\u2026 item I found which really confuses me. I was hoping you guys could\u2026 well, help me out a bit.</p><br><p>Yel: We can try our best. What do you have for us today?</p><br><p><em>Elizabeth pulls out the vial, now full of black liquid, and sets it on the table.</em></p><br><p>Elizabeth: I found this while exploring <a href=\"/level-55\">Level 55</a>, and I didn't really know what it was until now. As far as the M.E.G. told us, it was just a black vial, but they didn't actually run tests on it. From what I have heard, I'm the first one who's used this stuff, and I don't trust the M.E.G. anyway.</p><br><p><em>Yel picks up the vial and inspects the contents, shaking the glass container slightly and hearing the dink of the crystal.</em></p><br><p>Yel: I can hardly see through the stuff. What did you use this for, and what's inside?</p><br><p>Elizabeth: It's a really thick fluid which I confused for healing ointment. I was in a really big rush, so\u2026 I didn't bother checking what I was putting on me. Inside of the murk is a black crystal.</p><br><p>Yel: Black you say? Did you touch it at all?</p><br><p>Elizabeth: After hearing about that one entity who can <a href=\"/entity-297\">kill you by touching you</a>, I don't trust black crystals.</p><br><p>Yel: Exactly what I was thinking. We'll run this by some of our other Diggers to see if they can figure things out. Back to the discussion, what did you use this liquid for?</p><br><p>Elizabeth: Well I got a large gash on my arm from a <a href=\"/entity-3\">Smiler</a> attack recently, and I was running away while pulling out medicine to stop the bleeding. Turns out I pulled out this stuff and as soon as I poured it on my arm it burned like all hell. Think of someone putting a flamethrower to your wounded arm and then poking around with a rod. It\u2026 phew, it made me pass out after a minute or so.</p><br><p>Yel: I can imagine. Damn, that does not sound fun at all.</p><br><p>Elizabeth: Yeah, it wasn't.</p><br><p>Yel: What happened after? I can see there's no injury on your arm.</p><br><p>Elizabeth: I woke up two days later with no injury. Had my friends tend to me while I was out, but they say that the injury just\u2026 mended itself. My buddy Josh said that the flesh was just coming back, like I was growing skin and muscle. I don't know how that's even possible, but hey, I'm not complaining.</p><br><p>Yel: Very interesting\u2026 well, if that's all, we'll take this vial for research and get back to you soon.</p><br><p>Elizabeth: Will do. I'll see you guys later.</p><br><p>Yel: Until next time, Elizabeth.</p><br><p><em>Elizabeth gets up and leaves the building, a door closing softly in the background.</em></p><br><p>Yel: Let's get this thing studied. I highly doubt that something can heal you like this without drawbacks.</p><br><p>Five weeks later, the Repository released this statement:</p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:200%;\">\u26a0\ufe0f| Warning |\u26a0\ufe0f</span></p><br><p>Wanderers who obtain vials filled with black liquid accompanied by a black crystal are not recommended to consume said liquid, apply it to wounds, or insert it into one's body by any means.</p><br><p>Due to research documented over a five week period, we at the Repository highly discourage the use of said liquids. Consumption will affect the applied area, such as one wanderer's case of an arm injury.

    "description": "<p>Photo of an unused Spirit Link, currently sitting in M.E.G. possession for study</p><br><p>Spirit links are small hats that can be found in The Quartz Quadrant, a mysterious section of the Blue Channel that is home to <a href=\"/entity-600\">Entity 600</a>. The hats are very small, being around the size of an average human palm. Spirit Links always have a very powerful gem in the middle of the hat which causes the hat to work. Without the gems, the hats are useless. The gems resemble small, galaxy-colored nebulas. The gems display a small fractal design that moves similarly to a tornado. The gems should <strong>not</strong> be taken out of the hats, as they cannot be reunited. If the gem is separated from the hat, both objects become useless, and the gem will turn into a black rock.</p><br><p>Notably, Spirit Links appear to only function properly on The Saberzoa. When placed on any other living creature, the effects are extremely unpredictable. The first time that one of the hats was placed on a human, it caused their eyes to glow and then explode. Another test resulted in the person growing 6 extra eyeballs. Another test resulted in the person regressing into a vegetative state. One wanderer described himself placing one on a Skin-Stealer in a desperate act of self defense. This caused the Skin-Stealer to become paralyzed; however, it was suddenly able to speak English fluently. None of these effects have been successfully reversed. Other tests include a <a href=\"/entity-8\">Hound</a> bursting into flames, a <a href=\"/entity-130\">Growler</a> suddenly moving in inverted gravity, and \u2014 notably \u2014 a lack of any result when tested on a <a href=\"/entity-43\">Wormling</a>. Certain higher-up operatives have proposed trying to use the objects as a source of renewable energy. The Oversight Council has prohibited this for the time being due to their nature.</p><br><p>Spirit links usually take the form of various different types of hats, ranging from top hats to berets to baseball caps. The gem itself feels and weighs like a typical jewel of that size, being slightly heavy but pretty balanced in weight. The gems and hats are also likely indestructible and cannot be destroyed with any amount of force if powered. Gems which have been separated from the hats lose this ability and can be easily destroyed, along with the hat. The gems are also incredibly difficult to remove from the Spirit Links, requiring usage of powerful industrial machinery to extract. It is unknown exactly why this is, since the gems simply rest on the hat itself rather than in a small nook.</p><br><p>The hats themselves have no specific locations or common areas where they can be found. They have been found on every level from <a href=\"/level-3\">Level 3</a> to <a href=\"/level-903\">level-903</a> to even <a href=\"/th3-sh4dy-gr3y\">TH3 SH4DY GR3Y</a>. How these hats got to these places is not known, but it can be assumed that it is connected to The <a href=\"/blue-channel\">Blue Channel</a> in some way, since <a href=\"/entity-600\">The Saberzoa</a> live in a unique spot of said level. Much concern has been raised by the M.E.G. wondering if the hats were ethical or not. Many higher-ups feared that the hats were actually some sort of mind-controlling device, and the object was nearly banned in settled areas such as <a href=\"/level-11\">Level 11</a>. After further study of the entities, it was realized that Spirit Links do not alter the mental state of the entity. It only acts similar to how a mood necklace would, expressing the emotion of the entity and giving it the ability to speak through telepathy. Many people describe the entity as having a cute, baby-like voice, but the exact desciption varies slightly.</p><br><p>A piece of pottery presumably depicting an ancient Saberzoa.</p><br><p>Excluding its obvious connection to Entity 600, the object has been found in recovered documents and artifacts from <a href=\"/the-lost\">The Lost</a>. Depicted on the right is an ancient piece of pottery which presumably depicts The Saberzoa before they were separated from their supply Spirit Links. Others have proposed that this depicts The Broodmother. A noteworthy feature is that rather than being attached to a hat, the gem is attached directly to the forehead. It is unknown if this is an error, an artistic liberty, or perhaps a clue to the origin of these mysterious objects. Other old writings and letters describe sea creatures of unfathomable pulchritude and magical powers. Many of the documents detail these creatures as gods or angels. Certain living members of The Lost can recite passed down tales which describe their aquatic gods, but the connection to The Saberzoa \u2014 if it exists \u2014 has been lost to time. Many members of the group have been more than willing to aid The M.E.G. in piecing together these loose bits of information.</p><br><p>Spirit Links have a strange effect that causes them to change colors. When unused, they are grey and colorless. Extended periods of time can even cause the area around the object to turn slightly grey. Spirit Links can be placed on the head of a wild Saberzoa for the hat to activate. The hat will begin to act in a similar way to a mood necklace, with the color of the hat changing according to the mood of the entity. Below is a set of observations supplied by a member of The Lost named Caedmal Tun\u2019s extensive study of the entity.</p><br><p><span class=\"lost\"><span style=\"color: #000000\">For many moons I have wandered this treacherous realm in near-constant fear for my life. The unholy beasts I have witnessed and the nightmarish environment through which we wander have lost me many nights of sleep. Throughout all of this, though, I have found a light in the darkness that is never quenched. Adorable creatures which you know as \u201cThe Saberzoa\u201d have given me a sense of joy I have not known for a very long time. While this is the name you all know them by, they have been identified by many before you, all with their own systems of nomenclature, most notably \u201cNarcomeba\u201d and \u201cCartavela.\u201d My first encounter with these fascinating creatures happened a couple years ago. I was visiting <a href=\"/level-46\">The Arabian Desert</a> when I noticed the most peculiar thing: a little jellyfish was dying of dehydration on a rock. I immediately gave the creature my last supply of water and carried it for much distance until I found refuge. Within this refuge was a straw hat with a magical gem in the center. The Jellyfish attempted to escape my hands to put the hat on, which I aided it in doing. The Jellyfish suddenly gained the ability of communication and helped me find a way out to a safe haven. It has not left my side since we left. Since then, I have found many more instances of these animals and studied their appearance, ways of life, and intelligence extensively. I hope that my research will be beneficial to your group, and that maybe one day we will finally understand the tragedy that befell these innocent creatures and reunite them with their rightful treasures.</span><br/></span><br/>\n<span class=\"lost\"><br/></span></p><br><p><span class=\"lost\"><span style=\"color: #000000\">- Best, Caedmal Tun.</span></span></p><br><p>So far, these colors are the only documented ones, but there are presumed to be many more.</p><br><p>Spirit Links also have a property that give Saberzoa the ability to speak through telepathic messages. Wild Saberzoa, similar to normal jellyfish, have no ability to speak. However, once a hat is placed on their head, they can now send telepathic messages to any nearby wanderer as a way of speaking. It is presumed that the gem is what gives the creatures their telepathic abilities, but due to gems being difficult to separate from the Spirit Links \u2014 and unable to be placed back \u2014 this is not confirmed.</p><br><p>As previously mentioned, there is no specific level of The Backrooms which Spirit Links are confined to. While the objects are not nearly as rare as something like a <a href=\"/object-2\">Level Key</a>, for example, they are not a common item to find. Notably, however, they are most commonly found on <a href=\"/level-3\">Level 3</a>. It can be presumed that this is due to the level\u2019s notorious abundance of useful items, including rare ones. If one wants to actively look for a Spirit Link, it is advised to look on a safe level that is not infinite in length. This will provide the highest chance of finding one due to the small space and lack of external issues preventing the task.</p><br><p>Caedmal Tun has personally offered a reward of 10 <a href=\"/object-16\">Royal Rations</a> to the person that either finds/provides information which leads to the discovery of the event that separated The Saberzoa from their Spirit Links. He personally asked that this addendum be attached to this page. The M.E.G. has also begun aiding Caedmal in his quest to hopefully learn the truth about these creatures that\u2019s been seemingly lost to history and perhaps one day, restore their former glory.</p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong>Author</strong></span></p><br><p>The Saberzoa are adapted from an idea by <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/snomwriting\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7331266); return false;\"><img alt=\"SnomWriting\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7331266&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334085\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7331266)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/snomwriting\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7331266); return false;\">SnomWriting</a></span> and <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/karmaaisntavailable\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7442080); return false;\"><img alt=\"Karmaaisntavailable\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7442080&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334085\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7442080)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/karmaaisntavailable\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7442080); return false;\">Karmaaisntavailable</a></span>.</p><br><p>Writren by <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/natedagreat563\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7243253); return false;\"><img alt=\"Natedagreat563\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7243253&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334085\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7243253)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/natedagreat563\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7243253); return false;\">Natedagreat563</a></span><br/>\n<a href=\"/natedagreatap\">Author Page</a></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong>Licensing</strong></span></p><br><p>\u201cObject 36\u201d by Natedagreat563 is licensed under <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA 4.0</a></p><br><p><strong>Image Sources:</strong><br/>\n\u201cJellyfish Lineart drawing\u201d by LaDameBucolique is licensed under the <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/service/license/\">Pixabay License</a><br/>\n<a href=\"https://pixabay.com/illustrations/jellyfish-jellyfish-drawing-line-art-6769173/\">Source</a></p><br><p>\"Little Gem Nebula shows off its jewel tones\" by europeanspaceagency is licensed under <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\">CC BY 2.0.</a><br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/37472264@N04/30800304496\">Source</a></p><br><p>\"Cork bowler hat\" by tpholland is licensed under CC BY 2.0.<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/18964106@N00/8330043766\">Source</a></p><br><p>\"Terracotta stirrup jar with octopus, Late Helladic IIIC ca 1200\u20131100 BC.jpg\" by Jorge El\u00edas is licensed under CC BY 2.0.<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/28426323@N08/9565747015\">Source</a></p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/object-35\">Object 35</a> | Object 36 | <a href=\"/object-37\">Object 37</a> \u00bb</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/object-36\">Object 36 - Spirit Links</a>\" by Natedagreat563, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

    "description": "<p>Star Candy is a type of colorful candy found in the Backrooms created from unknown sources. Typically found in <a href=\"/level-1\">Level 1</a>, Star Candy can induce a calming effect when consumed. Star Candy is a useful substance due to its qualities of re-energizing and supplying positivity. Because of this, Star Candy is highly useful in many situations.</p><br><p>Star Candy helps wanderers regain energy, and can give positive feelings if consumed. Consuming an appropriate amount of Star Candy can also help treat minor injuries such as scratches, bruises, and paper cuts. Interestingly, when in consuming Star Candy, wanderers report feeling calm and relaxed, while <a href=\"/entity-9\">Facelings</a> and <a href=\"/entity-8\">Hounds</a> display the '11 Effect' after consuming it. It is unknown how other entities would react if it consumed Star Candy; other entities consuming it has never been sighted before. Star Candy also glows under black light.</p><br><p>If wanderers consume large amounts of Star Candy frequently, they can become addicted to it. It is important not to become addicted to Star Candy, because wanderers addicted to it become feral and try to consume Star Candy at all costs. There have been many sightings of addicted wanderers killing others for vials of Star Candy, and reports of restaurants being broken into for their stock of Star Candy. Wanderers are recommended to avoid others that start acting agitated or restless after indulging large amounts of Star Candy.</p><br><p>Star Candy is used by wanderers that want to regain energy, feel hopeful, and to heal themselves. Some wanderers enjoy it as a small treat, while others use it as medicine or an aid for helping with panic. Star Candy can also heal minor wounds if used in appropriate amounts.</p><br><p>Star Candy can be boiled in <a href=\"/object-1\">Almond Water</a> to make a flavored beverage called Star Juice (see recipe below). Star Juice has mostly the same effects as Star Candy and Almond Water. It is a popular drink on many Levels with restaurants, cafes, or vending machines. As stated above, Star Candy is addictive, so it is important to safely consume small amounts at a time.</p><br><p><strong>You need:</strong><br/>\n1 bottle of Almond Water<br/>\n5 pieces of Star Candy</p><br><p><strong>Step 1</strong><br/>\nPour the Almond Water in a pot and drop all the Star Candy into it.</p><br><p><strong>Step 2</strong><br/>\nBoil the Almond Water until all the Star Candy is dissolved.</p><br><p><strong>Step 3</strong><br/>\nWait until the beverage is cooled, or until desired temperature.</p><br><p><strong>Step 4</strong><br/>\nPour into a tumbler and shake.</p><br><p><strong>Enjoy!</strong></p><br><p>Star Candy is mostly found in crates on <a href=\"/level-1\">Level 1</a>, but it is also found in vending machines located in various Levels of the Backrooms, such as those on <a href=\"/level-6-1\">Level 6.1</a>. Star Candy is a fairly common object; it is easy to find, and many wanderers keep some with them.</p><br><p>The author of this article is <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pearbranch\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7962133); return false;\"><img alt=\"Pearbranch\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7962133&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334085\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7962133)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pearbranch\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7962133); return false;\">Pearbranch</a></span>.</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/object-37\">Object 37</a>\" by Pearbranch, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

    "description": "<p>Before use, RLWL has the appearance of a white stick, and nothing more. The object is coarse and bumpy in texture, and uncomfortable to hold in one\u2019s hand. Sticks of RLWL may measure anywhere between 5 and 20 inches long, with the diameter of an average pointer finger. Sticks of RLWL are almost identical in appearance to <sup>G9</sup><sub>hS54</sub> apart from the Backrooms Robotics insignia engraved on them.</p><br><p>If stuck in anything with a sufficiently high microbial count, an RLWL stick will rapidly change color, turning a vibrant red. RLWL will only detect biological hazards such as bacterial, viral, or fungal contaminants. RLWL is not able to test for chemical toxins or radiological threats (though other tests are available for such hazards). Once a stick has turned red, it cannot be re-used. Wanderers are advised to dispose of used sticks, and to obtain new sticks as soon as possible.</p><br><p><sup>G9</sup><sub>hS54</sub> is the raw form of RLWL, and is extremely dangerous. Raw sticks of <sup>G9</sup><sub>hS54</sub> are considered a biological hazard. In non-sterile environments, sticks of <sup>G9</sup><sub>hS54</sub> have been found to not only absorb microbes in their surroundings, but to act as breeding grounds which harbor and promote the growth of harmful micro-organisms. Worst of all, once saturated with microbes, raw sticks have been known to release them into their immediate surroundings, resulting in severe biological contamination.</p><br><p>Though most entities are not susceptible to the microbes absorbed by raw <sup>G9</sup><sub>hS54</sub>, it is believed that entities with sufficient intelligence are aware of the biological hazard they pose to their habitat. This might explain why some entities attempt to get rid of the sticks by offering them to passing Wanderers.</p><br><p>Despite the hazardous nature of <sup>G9</sup><sub>hS54</sub> , the M.E.G. assures wanderers that it is not a major cause for concern.

This object detects if any food or drink contains microbial contaminants, without the need for microscopic examination.</p><br><p>Jessica Ryans: This could be interesting. It's about time-</p><br><p>Alexander Azeil: Now wait a minute.. We all know about what this object used to be. <sup>G9</sup><sub>hS54</sub> to be precise. How do we know that it's safe now?</p><br><p>Sarah Jones: Yeah\u2026 good point. Maybe you could demonstrate it for us on camera?</p><br><p>Interviewee: Of course. Please give me a moment\u2026</p><br><p><em>(The interviewee moves the camera towards an experimental set-up. On one plate is a fresh red apple. On another is a wilted, rotting apple. Between the two is a stick of Red Light White Light.)</em></p><br><p>Interviewee: Observe that the fruit on the right appears safe to eat. I will now test it.</p><br><p><em>(The interviewee rubs the stick of RLWL across the surface of the apple repeatedly. The stick remains white. The interviewee proceeds to take a bite out of the apple, and proceeds clearly unharmed.)</em></p><br><p>Interviewee: Observe that the fruit on the left is covered in mold, and is clearly unsafe for consumption. I will now test it.</p><br><p><em>(The interviewee moves the RLWL towards the rotten apple. As soon as the stick makes contact with the apple, its tip turns a bright red, the color rapidly spreading up the entirety of the stick. The interviewee holds the red stick up to the camera one last time, before setting it down with a flourish.)</em></p><br><p>Jessica Ryans: See guys? I knew this was big!</p><br><p>Alexander Azeil: I guess\u2026 but a couple more things before I'm willing to approve this.</p><br><p>Interviewee: Yes?</p><br><p>Alexander Azeil: We've heard rumors that one of your employees went missing recently. This wouldn't happen to have to do with the production of this object?</p><br><p>Interviewee: This has nothing to do with our product, Doctor Azeil. The employee in question was causing trouble to begin with. We had them\u2026 terminated\u2026 from employment.</p><br><p>Alexander Azeil: Hmph\u2026 I suppose that's normal. One last thing. Could you outline the manufacturing process of this product?</p><br><p>Interviewee: I'm not sure what you mean by that.</p><br><p>Sarah Jones: I believe he's trying to ask what changes you've made to the object to make it safe?</p><br><p>Interviewee: Well, that is a rather technical matter, and I don\u2019t think it will be necessary for this interview-</p><br><p>Alexander Azeil: Well, see, I\u2019m a researcher too. Matter of fact, <em>all of us</em> here are research staff. And <em>I</em> want to know.</p><br><p>Interviewee: Do we have a problem, Doctor Azeil? You seem to be rather\u2026 uncooperative. I have shown you that the object works. I have used it, and I am not dead. Is that not proof enough?</p><br><p>Alexander Azeil: I just want to remind you of what happened the last time you tried to sell us something. <a href=\"/object-8\">Object 8</a> turned out to be-</p><br><p>Interviewee: Are you questioning the integrity of the Backrooms Robotics?</p><br><p>Alexander Azeil: Oh I absolutely am questioning your integrity, because you were <strong>using the lamps to spy on us-</strong></p><br><p>Interviewee: For the last time, the cameras were necessary for the object\u2019s navigational system to calib-</p><br><p>Alexander Azeil: We have <strong><em>NO REASON TO TRUST-</em></strong></p><br><p>Jessica Ryans: <strong>ALEX! ENOUGH.</strong> Let\u2019s give her a chance to speak for herself, shall we?</p><br><p>Interviewee: Thank you, Ms Ryans. Now, if you would have <em>let me finish</em>, Mr Azeil, I was going to offer to send you the files detailing the design and operation of our RLWL sticks after this meeting.</p><br><p>Jessica Ryans: That sounds good! If it really bothers Alex that much, we can all meet in person. It'll be much easier to ensure that everything is working as intended!</p><br><p>Interviewee: That is fine. However\u2026 now that I have shown you the object functioning correctly, may I confirm that RLWL has your conclusive approval before we conclude this meeting? We would hate to begin mass production only to have you cancel on us.</p><br><p>Alexander Azeil: I don\u2019t think-</p><br><p>Interviewee: Let me assure you all - the Backrooms Robotics prides itself in helping travelers. We would <em>never</em> release something unsafe for public use. You have no need to worry. On our end, we have tested the product extensively, and I give you my word that it is <em>completely</em> safe for use.</p><br><p>Jessica Ryans: Sure! The product is clearly safe to me, and I could see it being very useful. If I have your permission, Alexander?</p><br><p>Alexander Azeil: I don't think\u2026 Ugh.

    "description": "<p>The Backrooms TCG is a tactical asymmetrical trading card game based on everyone's favourite hellhole, the Backrooms! Featuring all of your favourite Levels, Entities and Objects to collect, trade and battle with! You may find Backrooms TCG booster packs, well, uh\u2026 anywhere! It's kind of random actually, we had an accident with the printer and now it's sending packs all over the place\u2026 but you can get them at various places! I hear someone found a pack inside a box of <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-16\">Royal Rations</a> thinking there'd be food inside\u2026 some stores should have them too? We hope so, at least.</p><br><p>The very first set of the Backrooms TCG has just been released! Each pack contains.. some number of cards! Completely randomized! Will you get the fabled all-rares pack? Only one way to find out! Hm? Why is the number random? Well, we can't control the damned printer! Want to know what types of cards you're gonna find in packs of Backrooms TCG? No? Well, too bad!</p><br><p>These are the key pieces to our game. Players represent a team of a certain G.O.I., and these cards indicate which one you're playing as! They determine what cards can and cannot be in your deck, as well as your win condition!</p><br><p>Levels are the bread and butter of the Backrooms, so of course we had to give them some love with our game! Each Level card has two unique abilities, one static and one triggered Encounter ability. Players will <strong>explore</strong> various Levels throughout a game, establishing outposts and encountering entities along the way!</p><br><p>Entities are the real meat of the game. Whether they're ordinary fauna and flora, humans just trying to survive, or powerful god-like beings, Entities take a central role in our game, much like in the Backrooms themselves. Each entity may perform an Action each turn. It can be an attack on an opposing Entity, Outpost, or activating a powerful ability. Each Entity will also have a cost, usually paid in Food, an attack and a life value, and a carrying capacity value. Let's go over each of these numbers, some of which are found in other types of cards.</p><br><p>The required cost to play a card. Aside from Levels and G.O.I. cards, all cards have a Cost. This Cost is usually paid with Food, the game's resource. We'll talk more about Food later. A cost of X can be paid with any amount of Food, and cards with this type of cost will usually have effects that scale with how much Food you spend on them. Cards with a cost of ? can't be played normally from your hand. You'll have to figure out some other way to put them into play!</p><br><p>The amount of damage the Entity will do when attacking.</p><br><p>Taking damage will lower an Entity's Life. Once that value reaches zero or lower, the Entity is trashed.</p><br><p>The amount of Objects an Entity can carry.</p><br><p>Objects are cards that provide you with additional effects. Like Entities, they require a cost (usually paid with Food) and they enter play attached to an Entity you control, if possible. If an Entity leaves play, any Objects attached to it stay in play, and they can be picked up by other Entities you play later. Objects can only be used by the Entities holding them. Objects range from one-use Consumables, to powerful gear for your Entities and other valuable items!</p><br><p>Once used, a Consumable is sent to the Trash.</p><br><p>Outposts are powerful cards that give you permanent benefits as long as you are in the same Level as them. Just turn them face down while you're not in the appropriate Level. If you move between Levels, any unattached Objects you control Clip Out with any Outposts you control.</p><br><p>The final card type, and the most simple! You pay a cost, play the card, apply the effect and discard the card. Easy!</p><br><p>A game of Backrooms TCG starts with players' decks on the table and their G.O.I. cards turned face up. A player's deck contains 40 cards, with a maximum of three copies of each card, although some exceptions may apply. A player's deck may only contain cards from their chosen G.O.I. and neutral cards. After both G.O.I. cards have been revealed, all players select 3 Levels and shuffle them all together. This will be the Level Deck for the game, and should be placed at the center of the table. After that, the player going second picks level 0, 1, or 2. If the game has more than two players, this choice will be made randomly. The chosen level will be the starting Active Level for the game. A special Explore die should phase in, and once it does, both players' decks will be automatically shuffled! A few of the perks of making anomalous card games! Each player then draws 5 cards, unless their G.O.I. card states otherwise. After everything is all set, the game can begin! If there are only two players, the first player skips their draw on their first turn.</p><br><p>Both players have a deck, a trash pile, their hand, and the field. There are no restrictions regarding the position of cards on the field. Players are free to organize their cards in hand and field however they please. Placement of these zones can be left up to the player, but we recommend having your deck to your right, with the Trash Pile directly behind it.</p><br><p>The Level Deck, as well as any Neutral Entities, will be placed on the center of the play area.</p><br><p>At the start of your turn, you draw a card. Afterwards, you're free to perform any number of actions and play any number of cards, in whichever order you'd like. Each entity may perform one Action per turn, and you may Stash a card once each turn. Let's go over the Actions players can take.</p><br><p>Once, at the start of your turn, you may place a card from your hand on your Stash face-up to draw a card. Then, you'll gain 1 Food for each card on your Stash, which you can then use to play cards and activate abilities! A player's Stash may contain a maximum of ten cards.</p><br><p>When you attack, you're spending an Entity's Action to deal damage to an opposing entity equal to its attack value. That opposing entity will deal damage to your attacking entity equal to its power, too. If the damage is enough to reduce an Entity's life to zero or lower (also known as taking \"lethal damage\"), that entity is trashed.</p><br><p>Some effects will require an Entity's Action to activate. Usually, these effects will be on the Entity itself, though Outposts and Objects may require an Entity's Action to activate their effects, too.</p><br><p>A card's effect may instruct players to create a card. If that happens, don't worry! Our patetended anomalous technology will place as many copies of that card as specified in the effect into play from outside the game.</p><br><p>Sometimes, cards will Create entities that do not belong to any player. These entities, usually generated by a Level's effect, take their turn after all players have done so, and will perform an attack, targeted at a random non-Neutral Entity.</p><br><p>These are simple. On Arrival effects trigger when the card enters play. On Departure effects trigger when the card leaves play!</p><br><p>A card may, during the course of a game, clip out of the current Active Level due to an effect. In that case, turn the card and anything attached to it face down. Those cards are treated as though they left play. This will trigger any On Departure effects. If the game returns to the Level those cards clipped into, or if an effect makes them Clip In by other means, turn them face up again. This will trigger any On Arrival effects.</p><br><p>When you Trash a card, place it on that player's Trash zone. Simple, right?</p><br><p>Whenever an effect tells you to Annihilate a card, remove it from the game. There's no coming back from that one\u2026</p><br><p>If an Entity becomes Stunned, it loses its actions next turn.</p><br><p>A Disabled entity loses its text box until the end of it's controller's next turn. It can still attack, however.</p><br><p>Healing an Entity removes damage from it. Makes sense, right? If an effect instructs you to Heal X, you remove X damage from that entity. If no number is specified, remove all damage from the Entity instead.</p><br><p>If a card has Shield X, prevent the next X times it would take damage or be trashed by an effect. So, an Entity with Shield 2 would be protected against damage or trashing effects twice before the shields wear off.</p><br><p>Players may only have one copy of cards with Enigmatic on their deck, and a maximum of 5 Enigmatic cards per deck. Cards created by effects do not count towards this limit. This keyword is represented by a unique symbol on the top left corner of a card, and is usually reserved for powerful, unique cards that can swing the game in your favour, like this one!</p><br><p>Whenever you explore, you'll roll a special six-sided die with four blank sides, a no-clip side, and a special encounter side! If you roll a blank, you draw an additional card. If you roll No-clip, you may discard the current Active Level and flip over the next one in the Level Deck. If the Level Deck is empty, shuffle all discarded Levels into a new Level Deck before flipping over the new Active Level. Any unattached Objects in play are Trashed, unless their controller has an Outpost in play, in which case the Objects Clip Out with the Outpost. If you roll Encounter, the Active Level's Encounter ability will trigger! There are various cards that'll allow you to explore, usually at the cost of an Action.</p><br><p>If an effect instructs you to scavenge a card, you add a card of the specified type (if any) from your Trash to your hand.</p><br><p>A keyword used to indicate a card is Bound to a Level. Outposts are Bound to the Level you play them in, and there are a few cards Bound to specific Levels. If the Active Level isn't the Level a card is Bound to, it Clips Out until the game returns to that Level.</p><br><p>An Entity with Pacifist cannot declare an attack. You'll have to use their Action elsewhere!</p><br><p>If a card instructs you to Study X, look at the top X cards of your deck, then put them back on the top or the bottom of your deck in any order you'd like. If you were to Study 3, you could put all three cards to the bottom, or rearrange them on top however you'd like, or place one on the top and two on the bottom. It's up to you to choose how to distribute and order those cards.</p><br><p>Written by <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/snomwriting\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7331266); return false;\"><img alt=\"SnomWriting\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7331266&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334085\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7331266)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/snomwriting\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7331266); return false;\">SnomWriting</a></span></p><br><p>\"BRTCG Card Back\" by SnomWriting is licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0.

    "title": "Object 42 - \"Lightning In a Bottle\"",
    "description": "<p>Bottled Lightning is an electric charge of an estimated one billion (1,000,000,000) joules, which can be found in several Levels of The Backrooms, stored in glass containers, such as flasks, wine bottles, and many others. Despite the fact that these containers are usually made of glass, they can contain the lightning without the container shattering into pieces. The reason as to why this occurs is as of yet unknown.</p><br><p>One can easily identify instances of Object 42 by their appearance. The lightning moves around the container at very high speeds, and also emits an extremely bright light. It is recommended to touch these objects only when wearing sufficient hand protection, as to prevent heat related injuries<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup>. The lightning is normally contained by a cork stopper at the top of the container, but other methods of containment have been observed.</p><br><p>Opening the container in any way will release the electricity inside. When released, the Lightning searches for the closest conductor. Opening the bottle by removing the stopper yourself is highly discouraged, since the first thing the lightning will arc to will almost invariably be the person who opened it, as they are the nearest conductor.</p><br><p>The bottles themselves are extremely fragile despite holding all of that energy inside of them. When one is carrying Object 42, they should be extremely wary of the way in which they handle it to prevent any accidents. The danger posed by the fragility of the bottles has not deterred several people throughout The Backrooms from using the Object however, as Object 42 has seen widespread use as both a source of energy and a weapon.</p><br><p>There are 3 different variations of Object 42, two of which can be found naturally, and one which is artificially manufactured.</p><br><p>The most commonly occurring variation, blue lightning variants glow a vivid shade of blue, and emit the brightest lights out of all the variants. When released, they act just like electricity would, seeking the fastest path to the nearest conductor. Shaking the container will make it temporarily glow with a bright blue light. When applied to humans the charge is most often fatal, but in some cases it is survivable.</p><br><p>Blue lightning variants conduct through the best conductor in the room. Because of this, they may be unpredictable when released, so caution is advised when planning to use them in any way.</p><br><p>An artificially manufactured imitator of Blue lightning, Artificial variations were first manufactured by Frederick 'Rust Punk' Kaiser after experimenting with several different alternatives to Blue lightning energy harvesting in order to create a safer version of Bottled Lightning. The result was the Artificial lightning variation, which is significantly less bright, powerful, and hot compared to the previously mentioned counterpart. Because of this, it has seen widespread use as an energy source due to it's relative safety, but less use as a weapon due to its reduced power.</p><br><p>Artificial lightning variations tend to prefer conduction through metallic objects rather than living creatures. Because of this, one can open a bottle of Artificial lightning without getting hurt as long as there is a metal conductor nearby.</p><br><p>The most dangerous version of Bottled Lightning, Black lightning variations are thankfully not as common as their Blue lightning counterpart. Pitch black in colour, yet still emitting a faint glow, they are estimated to be ten times more powerful than the Blue lightning variations. These charges have been known to behave anomalously, \u00a0prioritizing conduction through living creatures when released from their containers, and have also been reported to randomly explode on some occasions, killing any living creatures that may be nearby.</p><br><p>As of now, Black Lightning cannot be efficiently and safely harvested as an energy source due to how dangerous and unstable it is. Should Wanderers encounter it, they are advised to stay clear and avoid it due to its unpredictable nature.</p><br><p>The following tests were conducted by Frederick Kaiser between the dates of <strong>24/5/2018</strong> and <strong>8/3/2019</strong> when first experimenting with the harvesting of Object 42, and the creation of Artificial lightning.</p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><span class=\"Kaiser\"><strong>Test number</strong>: 1-3<br/>\n<strong>Date</strong>: 24/5/2018<br/>\n<strong>Objects used</strong>: Object 42, Blue lightning variation<br/>\n<strong>Aim</strong>: To experiment with Object 42's conductivity.<br/>\n<strong>Test setup</strong>: The lightning was released by an automated mechanical hand into a room where one rod of copper wire was connected to a wattmeter.<br/>\n<strong>Results</strong>: The lightning was released, and immediately went for the wire in each test. The copper wire grew hot and glowed blue temporarily as the electrical current passed through it, but when the current reached the wattmeter, it blew up each time.<br/>\n<strong>Conclusion</strong>: If it's powerful enough to break a wattmeter, I'm pretty sure we're dealing with some serious shit.</span></span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><span class=\"Kaiser\"><strong>Test number</strong>: 4<br/>\n<strong>Date</strong>: 17/6/2018<br/>\n<strong>Objects used</strong>: Object 42, Blue lightning variation<br/>\n<strong>Aim</strong>: To further experiment with Object 42's conductivity.<br/>\n<strong>Test setup</strong>: The lightning was released by an automated mechanical hand into an empty room, with nothing that could constitute as a conductor inside of it.<br/>\n<strong>Results</strong>: The lightning immediately flowed to the mechanical hand, causing it to sizzle and break down.<br/>\n<strong>Conclusion</strong>: I may have, uh, <em>forgotten</em> the fact that that hand is also made of metal. This also kinda raises the question, how come it went for the copper wire in the previous tests, and not the arm?</span></span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><span class=\"Kaiser\"><strong>Test number</strong>: 5<br/>\n<strong>Date</strong>: 23/6/2018<br/>\n<strong>Objects used</strong>: Object 42, Blue lightning variation<br/>\n<strong>Aim</strong>: To further experiment with Object 42's conductivity.<br/>\n<strong>Test setup</strong>: The bottle was placed sideways in the middle of an empty room. A brick was waxed to the ceiling, and it was left there until the wax melted.<br/>\n<strong>Results</strong>: When the wax melted, the brick fell onto the bottle, smashing it to pieces and releasing the lightning. With nothing to conduct through, the lightning hit one of the walls instead, leaving a scorch mark and causing ozone to be created.<br/>\n<strong>Conclusion</strong>: So when it has nothing to conduct through, it's just regular lightning. Neat.</span></span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><span class=\"Kaiser\"><strong>Test number</strong>: 6-8<br/>\n<strong>Date</strong>: 10/7/2018<br/>\n<strong>Objects used</strong>: Object 42, Blue lightning variation<br/>\n<strong>Aim</strong>: To test the conduction preferences of Object 42.<br/>\n<strong>Test setup</strong>: In the three tests, Object 42 was placed in a room with two rods of metal, one made of aluminium, and one made of copper. In the first test, the distance between the rod of copper from the bottle was the same as the distance of the aluminium rod, but in the second and third tests, the bottle was placed closer to the aluminium and further away from the copper.<br/>\n<strong>Results</strong>: In all tests, the lightning always conducted through the copper.<br/>\n<strong>Conclusion</strong>: That explains the results in the previous tests then.</span></span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><span class=\"Kaiser\"><strong>Test number</strong>: 9<br/>\n<strong>Date</strong>: 21/7/2018<br/>\n<strong>Objects used</strong>: Object 42, Blue lightning variation<br/>\n<strong>Aim</strong>: To attempt the harvesting of Object 42 as an energy source.<br/>\n<strong>Test setup</strong>: The lightning was released by an automated mechanical hand into a room where one rod of copper wire was attached to a specialized battery theoretically capable of holding the energy exerted by the lightning.<br/>\n<strong>Results</strong>: The battery was blown up.<br/>\n<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Aw fuck, right when I thought I'd struck gold\u2026</span></span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><span class=\"Kaiser\"><strong>Test number</strong>: 14<br/>\n<strong>Date</strong>: 28/9/2018<br/>\n<strong>Objects used</strong>: Object 42, Black lightning variation<br/>\n<strong>Aim</strong>: To test the properties of a new variant of Object 42 which was recently reported throughout The Backrooms.<br/>\n<strong>Test setup</strong>: The same setup as Test 1 was used.<br/>\n<strong>Results</strong>: Before the automated hand could open the bottle, it burst open, burning the copper and causing the wattmeter and arm to explode.<br/>\n<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Woah, now <em>that's</em> a force to be reckoned with.</span></span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><span class=\"Kaiser\"><strong>Test number</strong>: 22<br/>\n<strong>Date</strong>: 10/10/2018<br/>\n<strong>Objects used</strong>: Object 42, Black lightning variation<br/>\n<strong>Aim</strong>: To test the properties of a new variant of Object 42 which was recently reported throughout The Backrooms.<br/>\n<strong>Test setup</strong>: The same setup as Test 1 was used, but with a silver rod instead of a copper one.<br/>\n<strong>Results</strong>: Same results as Test 14.<br/>\n<strong>Conclusion</strong>: So even the most durable conductor can't hold the charge from these things? What in the ever loving <em>fuck</em> is up with them? Side note as well, when experimenting with Black light variants, resource management should be a priority, as from what I've seen now, they're even rarer than Blue light variants, which are already rare in themselves.</span></span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><span class=\"Kaiser\"><strong>Test number</strong>: 25<br/>\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2/11/2018<br/>\n<strong>Objects used</strong>: N/A<br/>\n<strong>Aim</strong>: To attempt to artificially re-create an instance of Object 42.<br/>\n<strong>Test setup</strong>: A lightning rod was set up in <a href=\"/level-817\">Level 817</a> during a thunderstorm, and the lightning collected was transferred to a battery.<br/>\n<strong>Results</strong>: The energy was collected successfully in the battery.<br/>\n<strong>Conclusion</strong>: I mean, we got the energy, but this wasn't what I wanted. I want to collect it <em>just</em> like the other bottles.</span></span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><span class=\"Kaiser\"><strong>Test number</strong>: 26<br/>\n<strong>Date</strong>: 27/11/2018<br/>\n<strong>Objects used</strong>: N/A<br/>\n<strong>Aim</strong>: To attempt to artificially re-create an instance of Object 42.<br/>\n<strong>Test setup</strong>: Same as the previous test, but the lightning rod was wired to a glass flask instead of a battery, similar to those found in the naturally occurring bottles. A copper rod connected to a battery was in the room as a precaution.<br/>\n<strong>Results</strong>: The bottle was shattered, and the lightning went into the copper rod the same way it had in previous tests.<br/>\n<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Maybe I need to do it in a specialized bottle? The ones that occur naturally don't seem to be any different than normal glass.</span></span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><span class=\"Kaiser\"><strong>Test number</strong>: 27<br/>\n<strong>Date</strong>: 15/12/2018<br/>\n<strong>Objects used</strong>: N/A<br/>\n<strong>Aim</strong>: To attempt to artificially re-create an instance of Object 42.<br/>\n<strong>Test setup</strong>: Same as the previous test, but the lightning rod was wired to a reinforced glass flask. A copper rod connected to a battery was in the room as a precaution.<br/>\n<strong>Results</strong>: Same as previous test.<br/>\n<strong>Conclusion</strong>: I don't get it, what's so special about those goddamn bottles that hold them in the first place? Maybe using <em>them</em> could be the solution?</span></span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><span class=\"Kaiser\"><strong>Test number</strong>: 28<br/>\n<strong>Date</strong>: 28/12/2018<br/>\n<strong>Objects used</strong>: N/A<br/>\n<strong>Aim</strong>: To attempt to artificially re-create an instance of Object 42.<br/>\n<strong>Test setup</strong>: Same as the previous test, but the lightning rod was wired to a discarded bottle of naturally occurring lightning<br/>\n<strong>Results</strong>: The lightning was contained successfully, producing what is now known as the 'artificial variant'.<br/>\n<strong>Conclusion</strong>: I'm amazed that it worked, but disappointed at my common sense. Nevertheless, EUREKA!</span></span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><span class=\"Kaiser\"><strong>Test number</strong>: 29<br/>\n<strong>Date</strong>: 4/1/2019<br/>\n<strong>Objects used</strong>: Object 42, Artificial lightning variation<br/>\n<strong>Aim</strong>: To experiment with Object 42's conductivity.<br/>\n<strong>Test setup</strong>: Identical to tests 1-3<br/>\n<strong>Results</strong>: The lightning was released, and immediately went for the wire. Power was gauged at 100,000J.<br/>\n<strong>Conclusion</strong>: It's definitely not as strong as the Blue lightning variation, but it's still something!</span></span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><span class=\"Kaiser\"><strong>Test number</strong>: 30<br/>\n<strong>Date</strong>: 15/1/2019<br/>\n<strong>Objects used</strong>: Object 42, Artificial variation<br/>\n<strong>Aim</strong>: To further experiment with Object 42's conductivity.<br/>\n<strong>Test setup</strong>: identical to test 5<br/>\n<strong>Results</strong>: When the wax melted, the brick fell onto the bottle, smashing it to pieces and releasing the lightning. With nothing to conduct through, the lightning hit one of the walls instead, leaving a scorch mark. No ozone was created.<br/>\n<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Mostly similar to experiment 5, nothing's changed here.</span></span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><span class=\"Kaiser\"><strong>Test number</strong>: 31-33<br/>\n<strong>Date</strong>: 6/2/2019<br/>\n<strong>Objects used</strong>: Object 42, Artificial variation<br/>\n<strong>Aim</strong>: To test the conduction preferences of Object 42.<br/>\n<strong>Test setup</strong>: Identical to tests 6-8<br/>\n<strong>Results</strong>: In all tests, the lightning always conducted through the copper.<br/>\n<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Nothing different here either.</span></span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><span class=\"Kaiser\"><strong>Test number</strong>: 34<br/>\n<strong>Date</strong>: 18/2/2019<br/>\n<strong>Objects used</strong>: Object 42, Artificial lightning variation<br/>\n<strong>Aim</strong>: To attempt the harvesting of Object 42 as an energy source.<br/>\n<strong>Test setup</strong>: Identical to test 9.<br/>\n<strong>Results</strong>: The energy was stored in its entirety successfully.<br/>\n<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Success! This is going to save me <em>so</em> many hours of trying to barter for batteries!</span></span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><span class=\"Kaiser\"><strong>Test number</strong>: 42<br/>\n<strong>Date</strong>: 8/3/2019<br/>\n<strong>Objects used</strong>: Object 42, Black lightning variation<br/>\n<strong>Aim</strong>: The test was conducted accidentally after someone had brought an instance of the Black lightning variation into the room without knowing of its unstable properties.<br/>\n<strong>Test setup</strong>: N/A<br/>\n<strong>Results</strong>: The energy burst open, releasing a burst of deadly electricity into the room. However, instead of killing the people inside the room, it immediately went towards a broken clock, which was in the same room at the time of the incident.

    "description": "<p>As of writing, <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarot\">Tarot Decks</a></strong> are rarely found due to only 115 packs currently being discovered. The exterior of a standard pack resembles that of a typical Tarot Deck, along with the Tarot Cards inside matching its non-anomalous counterpart.</p><br><p>Upon opening an instance of Object 43, the contents of it will shoot out of the deck and shuffle themselves until they land on the deck, forming a stack of cards. While the cards are shuffling, wanderers are unable to view the contents of the cards due to them being blank. After the cards land on object 43, its anomalous effects will manifest once an individual reads the name of the top card in the deck out loud. Picking up a card while it is shuffling (and <strong>not</strong> on the deck) will immediately cause the card to reveal itself and its effects to trigger.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> Failure to perform this task within a 20-second time span will result in the instance combusting into flames.</p><br><p>After the manifestation of the selected card\u2019s effects, all remaining cards will place themselves back into the deck. Afterward, the deck will become inaccessible to wanderers for 48 hours for unknown reasons. Each card\u2019s abilities can be determined depending on the image and name written on the card, as well as the image\u2019s orientation. If the image is right-side up, the card is an \u201cUpright\u201d card, and if the image is upside-down then it is a \u201cReverse\u201d card.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup> If a wanderer attempts to turn the card to get a different outcome, the effect will instead instantly trigger.

Whenever <strong>Cashew Water</strong> comes into contact with Entities, it boosts their strength by approximately 50%, and typically makes them act in a more intelligent manner. The only exception to this is <a href=\"/entity-15\">Wretches</a> located on Level 178.1. When <strong>Cashew Water</strong> comes into contact with Wretches on Level 178.1, they will begin to show signs of docile-ness, and will act similarly to <a href=\"/entity-9\">Facelings</a> located on <a href=\"/level-11\">Level 11</a>.</p><br><p>If <strong>Cashew Water</strong> comes into contact with any human, they will begin to feel numbness in that general area, followed by immense pain. If ingested by humans, their current mental state will rapidly deteriorate, and they will attract entities to them quickly. This process has a high chance of turning humans into Wretches. The only known way to reverse this process is by immediate ingestion of <a href=\"/object-1\">Almond Water</a>.</p><br><p>In order to test whether or not water is <strong>Cashew Water</strong>, a taste test has to be done. Be sure to have Almond Water ready for ingestion just in case. Never attempt to taste any <strong>Cashew Water</strong> without Almond Water. As <strong>Cashew Water</strong> is found most commonly on Level 178.1 and Negative Levels, do not trust any liquids on those floors.</p><br><p>If you collect any <strong>Cashew Water</strong>, be sure to label it as such. Do not let any <strong>Cashew Water</strong> come into contact with Entities.</p><br><p>On <a href=\"/level-178-1\">Level 178.1</a>, hot springs have a chance of containing <strong>Cashew Water</strong> instead of regular water. In order to obtain <strong>Cashew Water</strong>, take a bottle which once held almond water and throw it into a hot spring containing <strong>Cashew Water</strong>. Around 5-10 seconds later, it will fall out once more, filled with almond water. Be sure to throw the bottle in capped, or else all the <strong>Cashew Water</strong> will spill out once returned. This has been determined to be the easiest method of obtaining <strong>Cashew Water</strong>.</p><br><p>Most Negative Levels contain a very high amount of <strong>Cashew Water</strong>, and low amounts of Almond Water. Because of this, trusting liquids on Negative Levels is highly dis-advised.</p><br><p><span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/yellowislol\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6284593); return false;\"><img alt=\"YellowISlol\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=6284593&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1731170070\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=6284593)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/yellowislol\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6284593); return false;\">YellowISlol</a></span><br/>\n<span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/stretchsterz\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6287336); return false;\"><img alt=\"Stretchsterz\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=6287336&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1731170070\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=6287336)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/stretchsterz\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6287336); return false;\">Stretchsterz</a></span> is thanked for his advice on Negative inclusion!</p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/object-43\">Object 43</a> | Object 44 | <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/object-45\">Object 45</a> \u00bb</p><br>",

They are composed of reinforced steel, crafted from scrap metal found on <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-2\">Level 2</a>. The dimension of each cube in its normal state is 4.5 inches.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> Compression Cubes are consistently sold to several different <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-m-e-g\">M.E.G.</a> branches and outposts of the <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/b-n-t-g\">B.N.T.G.</a>, but have recently made their ways into the trading systems of unaligned vagrants of the Backrooms.</p><br><p><br/></p><br><p>The following document is a recording that all personnel of Backrooms Robotics must read and listen to before handling a Compression Cube:</p><br><p>Hello! We here at Backroom Robotics have created our most recent artificially-engineered weapon, Compression Cubes. Our goal with this breathtaking invention is to ensure your survival against those lurking horrors hiding behind every corner so that everyone can have a much more settling experience here in the Backrooms. If you haven't already, everyone is required to read and sign the waiver at the very end of this article to ensure you are qualified to handle a Compression Cube moving forward.</p><br><p>If you, as an individual, were to face an oncoming threat, you'd need to know how the cube operates. To start, you will first need to press in with any of your four fingers as well as your opposable thumb on the center sections of faces 3 and 6. The purpose of this function is to prevent other entities here in the Backrooms from using the device against humans. Do not worry; each face will be labeled with the numbers 1 through 6 to avoid confusion.<br/></p><br><p>The standardized layout of a Compression Cube.</p><br><p>On the upper left corner of Face 4, you'll find a small engraved square that will eject the now \"compressed waste.\" Pushing down on the square for over four seconds will release the target's compressed body.<br/></p><br><p>Repeat the protocol above if you wish to use the Compression Cube again.</p><br><p>If the person holding the Compression Cube releases these pressure points located on faces 3 and 6, it is not thrown. The Compression Cube will still expand and engulf the user within the cube, compressing them to death. Make sure to release the device immediately after activation; do not hesitate by any means. Otherwise, you will suffer a fast and possibly painless death. Those who experience emotional distress or remain frozen in place out of sheer panic should not be trusted to operate a Compression Cube.</p><br><p><strong>Side notes to be aware of while testing:</strong></p><br><p><strong>Will Work:</strong></p><br><p><strong>Will Not Work:</strong></p><br><p>I hereby acknowledge that I will use the device for its intended purposes and not for my own benefit. I understand the nature of the Compression Cube and that I am qualified, in good mental health, and in proper physical condition to operate the device accordingly. In consideration of handling a Compression Cube, I fully understand the potential risks of causing serious bodily injury that could result in permanent disability, damaged vital organs, death, or \"unalive myself\" that may be caused by my actions or inactions of other participants. Conditions on the levels in which the event takes place or the negligence of other risks are either not known to me or not readily foreseeable at this time.</p><br><p>Backroom Robotics are not to be held reliable as a result of my ownership of the Compression Cube. Breaking the device and having it restored by the M.E.G. will result in a fee for selected resources I have on my person as a payment method. Failing to meet the essential requirements will result in being turned down or resorting to another form of compensation that must be paid in full.</p><br><p>I have read this release, waiver of liability, and assumption of risk. I understand that I have given up substantial rights by signing it and have signed it freely and without any inducement or assurance of any nature. I intend it to be a complete and unconditional release of all liability to the greatest extent. I agree that if any portion of this agreement is held to be valid, the balance, notwithstanding, shall continue in full force and effect.</p><br><p>Thus, this agreement has been executed by the parties associated with both the Backroom Robotics and M.E.G.<br/>\nSignature, X- Derek Crane\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003 Date:\u200308/23/2025\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003</p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/object-48\">Object 48</a> | Object 49 | <a href=\"/object-50\">Object 50</a> \u00bb</p><br><p>This was written by, <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/venomous-mount\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7160771); return false;\"><img alt=\"Venomous mount \" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7160771&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334085\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7160771)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/venomous-mount\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7160771); return false;\">Venomous mount</a></span> .<br/>\nThis was minorly revised by, <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/liurnia\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(8505191); return false;\"><img alt=\"Liurnia\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=8505191&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334085\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=8505191)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/liurnia\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(8505191); return false;\">Liurnia</a></span>.</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/object-49\">Object 49 - \"Compression Cubes\"</a>\" by Venomous mount , from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

This behavior is similar to how the prison bars in <a href=\"/level-3\">Level 3</a> or the tiles in <a href=\"/level-37\">Level 37</a> act.</p><br><p>All visible light that hits voidstone is absorbed. All surfaces of voidstone have the same perfect black color regardless of the viewing angle, making it impossible to discern corners or edges. Thus, samples of voidstone look two-dimensional.</p><br><p>Other forms of electromagnetic radiation, such as X-rays will also be absorbed; however, microwaves and radio waves are able to pass through. This allows <a href=\"/object-21\">Wi-Fi</a> to permeate through walls.</p><br><p>Despite absorbing all light that hits it, it will never heat up. Voidstone is a <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_reservoir\">thermal energy reservoir</a>; a substance with a heat capacity so large that it never changes temperature no matter how much heat it absorbs or releases. A block of voidstone at 0\u00a0\u00b0C will stay at 0\u00a0\u00b0C even surrounded by fire. A block of voidstone at 100\u00a0\u00b0C will stay at 100\u00a0\u00b0C even if surrounded by ice.</p><br><p>In some locations, voidstone has been found at temperatures of hundreds of degrees. Hot enough that it glows red hot. Analyzing the light emitted through an optical spectrometer shows that voidstone glows with a perfect <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_body\">blackbody spectrum</a>.</p><br><p>The surfaces of voidstone are frictionless. If not for air resistance, it would be possible to slide upon its surfaces indefinitely. This also makes it impossible to walk or stand on voidstone.</p><br><p>Voidstone is a perfect electric insulator, is hydrophobic, and does not allow air to pass through. It does not interact with gravity and will levitate stationarily if not supported by anything.</p><br><p>Voidstone is abundant and can be found in many levels, providing structural support to the levels\u2019 rooms. It also serves as a barrier between the exterior of the levels and <a href=\"/blue-channel\">The Blue Channel</a>. After digging a few meters through the surface-level materials, voidstone surfaces will be encountered. The surrounding concrete may also be reinforced with rebar made from voidstone. If this concrete is dug out, what gets left behind are floating voidstone rods.</p><br><p>It is unclear how voidstone rebar was able to embed itself into concrete given that it is unmovable. However, this rebar has been there as long as records date back. Whatever process created the Backrooms to begin with may be able to manipulate voidstone and create this rebar.</p><br><p>It is important to note that not all walls contain voidstone, so some walls can be tunneled through. Likewise, voidstone is not be present on all levels.</p><br><p>As the source of Wi-Fi has not been discovered, it is speculated that the source of Wi-Fi is located behind the voidstone walls, out of reach of any human.</p><br><p>Lights and machines within the levels continually produce heat. If there was no where for the heat to go, the rooms would heat up to hundreds of degrees. The voidstone serves as a heat reservoir, absorbing excess heat, keeping the levels at a stable temperature. The temperature of the voidstone varies between levels. For instance, the voidstone in <a href=\"/level-115\">Level 115</a> is -10\u00b0C and the voidstone in <a href=\"/level-3\">Level 3</a> is 18\u00b0C.</p><br><p>Rooms with equipment such as boilers or heaters can be significantly hotter than the surrounding voidstone base walls, analogous to how the interior of a house with a heater can be significantly warmer than the outside.</p><br><p>An infographic illustrating voidstone's presence levels is shown below. A cross-section of <a href=\"/level-0\">Level 0</a> is given as an example.</p><br><p>Cross-section of Level 0, demonstrating the presence of voidstone within the level.</p><br><p>Voidstone is rarely naturally exposed. If it is seen, then it almost certainly once had material covering it which was removed artificially.</p><br><p>Over the centuries, the various groups within the Backrooms referred to voidstone by different names. This presumably includes <a href=\"/the-lost\">The Lost</a>, but there are currently no known references to voidstone in recovered documentation. The first recorded use of the word \u201cvoidstone\u201d was in 1952 in a diary of someone who later became a founding member of The Aiding Stragglers. The term was used by Aiding Stragglers members and its usage spread from there.</p><br><p>No matter how hard I try, I can't get out of this vile place! The further I walk, the more dangerous it gets, and I've tried smashing down the walls and floors with some pickaxes I found in these crates, but all that happens is that I open a hole into some kind of void. Except it is not a void, it is just some slippery black stone. Voidstone I guess? I tried breaking that too, but when pickaxe does not slip, my pick just shatters.</p><br><p>Voidstone can be a nuisance as it limits how far walls can be tunneled through. However, wanderers have found ways to make use of it.</p><br><p>As voidstone does not change in temperature when heat is removed, an infinite amount of heat energy can be extracted.</p><br><p>Buried deep behind the surface walls and ceilings in some levels, cubic cavities have been discovered with exposed voidstone walls. One of these walls will have a temperature above 100\u00b0C and the wall on the opposite side will be below 0\u00b0C.</p><br><p>Thermoelectric generators, devices that convert heat directly into electricity, will appear in these cavities. Conducting copper rods extend out from the generators and are pushed against the two voidstone walls, generating electricity from the temperature differential between the walls. Wires from these generators spread the electricity to lights and other equipment.</p><br><p>After several decades of measurements, these walls have had no measurable change in temperature. How these walls got to abnormally high and low temperatures to begin with is not known.</p><br><p>Various groups have constructed their own generators that extract energy from this source.</p><br><p>As voidstone is frictionless, sliding objects across it is a fuel efficient way of transporting people and goods. In principle, a vacuum chamber with a voidstone floor could allow cargo to slide forever without propulsion. However, there are some technical limitations that have limited the usage of voidstone for this purpose.</p><br><p>To access the voidstone base floor, meters of surface-level flooring need to be dug through. There may be voidstone rebar, which is irremovable, leaving behind floating bars. It limits the height of vehicles, as vehicles that are too high will crash into these bars.</p><br><p>Wheels do not work on frictionless surfaces, so some other less convenient means of speeding up and slowing down vehicles is required, such as using linear induction motors, thrusters, or having wheels on the sides of the vehicles to push against walls. It is important for vehicles to be able to speed up and slow down easily to make their way through the twisted corridors.</p><br><p>For this reason, voidstone tracks have not been heavily used, which is also why <a href=\"/b-n-t-g\">The B.N.T.G.</a> chose to construct train tracks instead in <a href=\"/level-2\">Level 2</a>. However, <a href=\"/the-m-e-g\">The M.E.G.</a> has built an experimental voidstone track in Level 1.</p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/object-49\">Object 49</a> | Object 50 | <a href=\"/object-51\">Object 51</a> \u00bb</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/object-50\">Object 50</a>\" by Br Miller, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

    "description": "<p>An example of Object 51 with an opal pocketstone.</p><br><p><strong>Pockets are highly coveted by various groups for use in operations, or by wealthy individuals as a status symbol.</strong></p><br><p>While in possession of <strong>Object 51</strong>, wanderers gain the ability to \"pocket\" non-living, inert matter in their proximity at will. Pocketed items seem to suddenly dematerialize, but will reappear at the mental command of the user. Most users require direct contact with the target matter in order to manipulate it, but experienced Pocket-users are capable of influencing objects remotely.</p><br><p>Individuals in contact with a Pocket display uncanny, extrasensory knowledge of all matter contained within, regardless of the artifact's history. Objects stored within Pockets do not experience time, making them ideal for transporting items susceptible to rot, decay, or degradation.</p><br><p><strong>Pockets are believed to possess an infinite or near-infinite carrying capacity.</strong></p><br><p><strong>Pockets</strong> are relatively safe to use and handle so long as matter is not manipulated in a way that could be dangerous, such as materializing a heavy object above oneself. Much of the danger associated with Pockets occurs during recovery or as a result of their high value and demand. Owners without the protection of a group or faction often find themselves targetted and their Pocket stolen.</p><br><p><strong>It is advised that owners conceal their Pocket at all times, and only utilize it when unobserved or in the company of allies.<br/></strong></p><br><p>Homes in <a href=\"/level-9\">Level 9</a> with glowing windows often contain Pockets.</p><br><p>While not particularly difficult to find, <strong>Object 51</strong> is sourced from <a href=\"/level-9\">Level 9</a>, which has produced a mountain of corpses in exchange for every Pocket successfully recovered. Pockets are found in homes throughout the suburban area within safes, jewelry boxes, vaults, and display cases. Pocket-bearing houses frequently have vibrantly illuminated windows in a range of different colors. Shades of blue and green are the most common, though red, purple, and orange are also known. Pockets found outside of Level 9 are almost unheard of, but they are rumored to generate from jewelry worn by wanderers upon entry into the Backrooms.</p><br><p>A potential pocket-bearing structure.</p><br><p>Recovering a <strong>Pocket</strong> is incredibly risky, but doing so in groups of three affords the best chances of success. An escape route must be identified prior to a recovery attempt, ideally via grass fields leading to <a href=\"/level-10\">Level 10</a>, or by playgrounds leading to <a href=\"/level-283\">Level 283</a>. Distance to the exit point should never exceed one mile from the point of acquisition and all team members must be capable of independent navigation to the exit in under eight minutes.</p><br><p>Each recovery team should have a designated <em>Thief</em>, <em>Lookout</em>, and <em>Support</em>. The Thief is responsible for entering the pocket-bearing structure via the most discreet means available and acquiring the object. Brute force, such as breaking down doors or shattering windows is inadvisable. The Lookout is responsible for monitoring entity activity prior to acquisition by the Thief. The Support must be capable of assuming either role.</p><br><p>Run. Do not hide. Do not engage The Neighborhood Watch.</p><br><p>Upon acquisition of the <strong>Pocket</strong>, <a href=\"/entity-96\">The Neighborhood Watch</a> will be alerted, and shall converge on the area to eliminate all intruders. All team members must run to the preidentified exit as quickly as possible. Should the Thief become incapacitated, the Support must take the Pocket and continue running. Should the Support become incapacitated, the Lookout must take the Pocket and continue running. A recovery is successful when Level 9 is exited, at which point pursuit ceases.</p><br><p><strong>Those in possession of a Pocket should not enter <a href=\"/level-9\">Level 9</a> under any circumstances.</strong></p><br><p>By <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/noctilucian\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7714523); return false;\"><img alt=\"Noctilucian\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7714523&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334085\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7714523)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/noctilucian\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7714523); return false;\">Noctilucian</a></span></p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/object-50\">Object 50</a> | Object 51 | <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/object-52\">Object 52</a> \u00bb</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/object-51\">Object 51 - \"Pockets\"</a>\" by Noctilucian, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

(~18\u00a0cm) tall and 5 in. (~13\u00a0cm.) wide. The cover is red and worn with various stains, tears, and discoloration. The front cover is also blank, save for the previously mentioned title. The front pages, which presumably had the introduction and author on them, have been torn out for some reason. The author of the book is currently unknown.</p><br><p>Each page has one recipe on it, with each one always heavily involving backrooms-specific objects as the main ingredients, such as <a href=\"/object-15\">Firesalt</a> Cocktails and <a href=\"/object-16\">Royal Ration</a> milkshakes. The recipes all use the American Customary system, which has puzzled The M.E.G. even further in their quest for discovering the origin of the book. This book is also where the recipe for <a href=\"/object-11\">Memory Juice</a> came from, albeit with some differences to the transcription in the article.

Adding aromatics such as garlic, ginger, and any leftover shallots are recommended for additional flavor. Skip this step if eating the meat raw.</p><br><p><span style=\"color: #0080e0\">2:</span> Pre-measure each ingredient, except for the Strangler meat, into small containers and set aside. Take the meat and cut it into small, bite-sized pieces. Set aside.</p><br><p><span style=\"color: #0080e0\">3:</span> In a saucepan, heat the stock over medium-low heat. Once heated, leave on a low heat. Do not let the stock boil.</p><br><p><span style=\"color: #0080e0\">4:</span> In a separate, large pot, heat the oil and 1 tablespoon of the butter over medium heat. Saut\u00e9 the shallots for 2-3 minutes until translucent.</p><br><p><span style=\"color: #0080e0\">5:</span> Add the rice and continue saut\u00e9ing for 1-2 minutes, stirring frequently as to not brown the rice. By this point, the grains should give off a nutty aroma and be fully coated with the fat. Optionally, a splash of <a href=\"/object-1\">Almond Water</a> can be added for additional flavor.</p><br><p><span style=\"color: #0080e0\">6:</span> Add the wine in slowly and cook for 1 more minute, stirring constantly until the liquid is fully absorbed by the grains.</p><br><p><span style=\"color: #0080e0\">7:</span> Using a ladle, pour in a full scoop of stock and stir constantly until the liquid has fully absorbed. Do not add more than a ladleful at a time. It\u2019s very important at this step to not stop stirring as to not scorch the rice.</p><br><p><span style=\"color: #0080e0\">8:</span> As soon as the rice is mostly dry, add in another ladleful. Repeat this until all the stock has been used. This should take about 20-30 minutes. To test if it\u2019s done, the grains should be al dente.</p><br><p><span style=\"color: #0080e0\">9:</span> Once all the stock has been added, stir in the remaining butter and Parmesan cheese. Season to preferred taste with the salt.</p><br><p><span style=\"color: #0080e0\">10:</span> Fold in the chicken and serve in small, individual bowls. Garnish with additional Parmesan cheese and enjoy!</p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p><br><p><iframe allowtransparency=\"true\" class=\"html-block-iframe\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"/object-56/html/ca98f9c4a62560b4009357f91e44411c217fd418-8690687931028635\"></iframe></p><br><p><span class=\"top-title\"><span style=\"font-size:145%;\"><span style=\"color: #0080e0\">R</span></span></span>isotto is certainly not an easy recipe to make, but it is definitely worth it.

Using <strong>extreme caution</strong>, add in the Firesalt. Firesalt should be carefully sprinkled in and immediately mixed into the butter to avoid combustion. Stir in the brown sugar, flavor packet, and teriyaki sauce.</p><br><p><span style=\"color: #0080e0\">3:</span> Once a sauce has formed, add in your drained noodles and coat thoroughly.

When dissolved in something like Almond Water, the Firesalt immediately loses its spiciness, but in a hot sauce, the spiciness adds a fantastic flavor, believe it or not.

Combine all of the ingredients for the seasoning and set aside.</p><br><p><span style=\"color: #0080e0\">2:</span> Once seasoning is made, begin melting the butter over medium fire until liquified.</p><br><p><span style=\"color: #0080e0\">3:</span> Saut\u00e9e the peeled garlic for 2-3 minutes. Add in the paprika, old bay, and 3 Tbsp of the boil seasoning, and stir for an additional 30 seconds.</p><br><p><span style=\"color: #0080e0\">4:</span> Begin by making the actual boil. Take the largest and tallest pot possible and add an insert designed for seafood steaming. Fill it with water until the water just barely seeps through the strainer. Begin boiling over a high-heat fire.</p><br><p><span style=\"color: #0080e0\">5:</span> Start by prepping the vegetables. Half the lemons, garlic, and shucked ears of corn and set aside. Rough chop the yellow onions and set those aside as well.</p><br><p><span style=\"color: #0080e0\">6:</span> Using pre-cooked and pre-smoked pork sausage from Zoological Office based pork, cut the 2 pounds of sausage into 3 inch segments. Set aside.</p><br><p><span style=\"color: #0080e0\">7:</span> For the seafood, start by breaking the Sark Crab\u2019s legs off, separating each one into two meaty clusters. Cover the crawfish in a tub of water and let sit for about 8 minutes and then drain. Fill again, gently stir, and drain once more. Repeat this twice more. Set the seafood aside.</p><br><p><span style=\"color: #0080e0\">8:</span> Take <sup>3</sup>/4 cup + 2 Tbsp of your stock and pour it into a separate bowl. Combine with the soy sauce and vinegar.</p><br><p><span style=\"color: #0080e0\">9:</span> Once steamy, add the regular stock, flavored stock, and the rest of the ingredients to the water. Using a long, wooden spoon, stir gently.</p><br><p><span style=\"color: #0080e0\">10:</span> Add in your boil seasoning and hot sauce, giving it a thorough stir. Do not add all of the seasoning at once, and add it slowly to taste. The water should be spicy and have a strong Cajun flavor.</p><br><p><span style=\"color: #0080e0\">11:</span> Once the water reaches a strong boil, boil all of the potatoes for 10-15 minutes until almost cooked. Once the potatoes are ready, add in the sausage and seafood. Stir gently.</p><br><p><span style=\"color: #0080e0\">12:</span> Cover and reduce the temperature from a high to a medium-high flame. Let the pot gently boil for 10 more minutes.</p><br><p><span style=\"color: #0080e0\">13:</span> Add in the corn and immediately remove from the heat. Gently stir again and let the corn sit in the mixture for 5 minutes.</p><br><p><span style=\"color: #0080e0\">14:</span> Once boil is done, it\u2019s time to get messy. On a table, roll out newspapers across the entire top. Carefully lift the filter and drain the boil of its liquid. Dump the boil all over the table and pour the spicy butter all over it. Notify your guests that the boil is ready, and dig in!</p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p><br><p><iframe allowtransparency=\"true\" class=\"html-block-iframe\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"/object-56/html/c14788678606ada3e537f4847ae0796ef099d9cf-14139826601700755999\"></iframe></p><br><p><span class=\"top-title\"><span style=\"font-size:145%;\"><span style=\"color: #0080e0\">S</span></span></span>eafood boil is an experience that words cannot fully describe.

Something to note is that a few pages seem to have been torn out from the book, which presumably explains the lack of any introductory statements, closing remarks, author attributions, table of contents, or index/glossary.</p><br><p>The book is estimated to have been copied and distributed about 450,000 times across all levels of the Backrooms. All of the recipes, even ones that seem dangerous, such as the Spicy Egg Fried Ramen or Uncle Aussie\u2019s Bayou Surprise, have been proven to be entirely safe as long as they are prepared properly. Not only are they safe, but the recipes have received extremely popular reviews from food critics and wanderers alike. All of the recipes in the book have become incredibly popular and famous in societies such as <a href=\"/level-11\">Level 11</a> and <a href=\"/level-162\">Level 162</a>.</p><br><p>The book also references real places and brands, such as O\u2019Mio\u2019s bakery and Meri\u2019s Chin ramen. The prior of the two has existed for many years on 6.1, and was originally a small stand outside of the restaurants. Since the book\u2019s mass publishing, O\u2019Mio\u2019s bakery has become one of the most popular places on 6.1. The owner of the bakery, Minnie O\u2019Mio, claims to have no idea who could have possibly written the book, as she never had any regular customers until the book was found. She has welcomed the new wave of business though, and sells hundreds of her signature cocoa cookie sandwiches every day. Meri\u2019s Chin ramen was discovered on 480 not long after the book was found as well, which was previously an undocumented brand. It has since become one of the most sought out items on the level, and many wanderers have fallen victim to the level\u2019s infamous booby trapped products in hopes of obtaining the ramen. This simultaneously narrows down the time frame of when the book could have been written, while additionally putting it into even further question, given that <a href=\"/entity-155\">Entity 155</a> was also not yet discovered when the book was originally found.</p><br><p>The author of the book also seems to have incredibly vast knowledge of more mysterious levels, such as <a href=\"/level-480\">Level 480</a> and <a href=\"/level-66\">Level 66</a> \u2014 both of which the M.E.G. still has very limited knowledge about. This detail makes the quest of identifying the author all that more challenging. Many red herrings and fakers have come up in the case, but no substantial evidence has come forward, partially due to the unexplorable nature of Level 3. The B.N.T.G. has created an <a href=\"/object-56-supplementary-document\">unofficial supplementary document</a> for the community to post their own recipes.

    "title": "Object 60 - \"The Throne\"",
    "description": "<p>The Throne.</p><br><p><strong>Object 60</strong> is a metal chair of simple design painted in a dark green color with a glossy finish. As any normal chair, <strong>Object 60</strong> has 4 legs, a seat, and a back, though it doesn't have armrests. It is also notably well-kept, lacking any major scratches or dents. Further inspection has shown that the object resists all kinds of damage, and that moving it from the position where it spawns is impossible.</p><br><p><strong>Object 60</strong> was initially differentiated from a normal chair thanks to the investigations of Senior Archivist Ra\u00fal M\u00e1rquez, who had been previously studying the object for years. After months of instigation, the rest of the Archivists agreed to review Marquez's research, which, surprisingly, turned out to be accurate. His documents detailed dozens of sightings of what appeared to be a mundane green chair, all in numerous locations, and dating from a few months before to decades and even centuries in the past.</p><br><p>As previously stated, the object has the main characteristics of being resistant to any kind of damage and being impossible to move, but it also has other, more vague, and less understood properties. For instance, being in proximity to the object has the potential to slightly alter the human psyche. Subjects of low mental fortitude will see their memories challenged and be inclined to think that <strong>Object 60</strong> is an item precious to them that has been a part of their life for years, therefore being convinced to care it and protect it if necessary.</p><br><p>Aside from its already mentioned capabilities, <strong>Object 60</strong> is known to occasionally bestow one of a number of blessings to some of those who sit on it. The mechanism that decides who will benefit from the object remains a mystery, as there does not seem to be any factor linking all of its supposed beneficiaries.</p><br><p>According to M\u00e1rquez, who allegedly got access to secret, forbidden knowledge after sitting on the object for the first time, the following are the 5 possible \"boons\" that <strong>Object 60</strong> can grant:</p><br><p>The significance of many of these is yet to be discerned.</p><br><p>The object can be found in essentially any level of the Backrooms. Sighting reports mention encountering the object in the middle of the woods on <a href=\"/level-39\">Level 39</a>, half buried under the sands of <a href=\"/level-46\">Level 46</a>, and even hidden inside a closet on <a href=\"/level-4\">Level 4</a>. On all these occasions, the object seems to have appeared in random places of no significance. There is, however, a single sighting report submitted by Senior Archivist M\u00e1rquez in which <strong>Object 60</strong> manifested itself in a place of importance.</p><br><p>M\u00e1rquez's report remarks how on one occasion his investigations took him to <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/the-chair-room\">The Chair Room</a>, where he witnessed a series of strange events. The archivist was greeted to the room by chants, whispers, and prayers coming from the group known as \"The Zealots of the Chair.\" Although these were almost unintelligible, M\u00e1rquez managed to discern phrases such as: \"\u2026 our lord \u2026 back\" and \"\u2026 God-King \u2026 finally returned.\" Another odd aspect was that the room was crammed with chairs of every possible type, as opposed to the room's usual consistent distribution. And, in addition, instead of being neatly arranged, the chairs were all circling <strong>Object 60</strong> in a \"reverential\" manner.</p><br><p>According to M\u00e1rquez, all the chairs had gathered to pay their respects to <strong>Object 60</strong>, which he referred to as \"The Throne.\"</p><br><p>Written by <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/vivamusludio\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(3282732); return false;\"><img alt=\"VivamusLudio\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=3282732&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334082\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=3282732)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/vivamusludio\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(3282732); return false;\">VivamusLudio</a></span> | <a href=\"/vivamusludio\">Author Page!</a><br/>\nFor Classicon 2023</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/object-60\">Object 60 - \"The Throne\"</a>\" by VivamusLudio, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

    "description": "<p><strong>Object 61</strong> or <strong>Booreson's vessels</strong>, after the late B.N.T.G. Food Dept. head Agatha Booreson, is the collective term for any one of a series of objects that meet the following criteria:</p><br><p><strong>1.</strong> Object can generally be referred to as a \"sailboat\". Make and model vary across instances, although all resemble existing Frontrooms models.</p><br><p><strong>2.</strong> Object contains no traces of animal, plant, fungal, or microbial life on any of its surfaces upon entrance to a level.</p><br><p><strong>3.</strong> No preexisting records or accounts of said object exist within the surrounding area/level in which it manifests. Especially in terrestrial areas, object may alter its immediate surroundings to \"explain\" its position outside of water.</p><br><p><strong>4.</strong> Object shows mild to significant signs of wear.</p><br><p><strong>5.</strong> Object does not require the assistance of others to enter and leave any one level, and will do so of its own volition.</p><br><p>Any undocumented objects that match the above criteria, especially criteria <strong>1</strong> and <strong>5</strong>, should be immediately photographed and reported for further investigation and/or classification to an instance of Object 61. Exploration of any Object 61 instance is highly discouraged, as <em>any known or suspected instances of Object 61 are extremely unsafe to enter.</em></p><br><p>Object 61 instances are labelled numerically in order of their discovery. Currently, twelve instances have been documented. Object 61.1 was first recorded by Booreson in September of 1990, and each new discovery has postdated the previous by a span of two to fifty-one months.</p><br><p>Of particular interest are the paths that mobile instances of Object 61 take across levels. With several exceptions, the route between two levels an instance has been recorded travelling between are known to be traceable by humans by physical and/or aphysical means, albeit often with difficulty.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> While the direct usage of instances of Object 61 to traverse levels is almost certainly fatal to humans, further insight on potential traversal between levels could be gathered by continuing to track their progress across the Backrooms.</p><br><p><strong>Objects 61.1 through 61.12</strong> often accrue hardier life-forms in and on their surfaces (bacteria, algae, moss, etc.) throughout the course of their stay in a single level; however, continuous species and age sampling of said life-forms across Object 61 instances suggests a total removal or sterilization of all organisms present on the object in the traversal process.<br/>\nThis is assumed to apply to humans as well. Any testing of this assumption is, for a variety of reasons, <em>highly discouraged</em>.</p><br><p>Instances of Object 61, upon arriving in a level, may remain in place for months or years at a time. Likewise, they may disappear unrecorded for similar timespans. Object 61 instances cannot be reliably followed once they depart a level, so it is difficult to predict their whereabouts. Generally, it is safe to assume they have resurfaced in undocumented levels or areas of known levels, having taken exits yet to be discovered.</p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:smaller;\">Object 61.1 in the cityside sector of Level 563, its most recent resting place. Upon entering terrestrial areas of levels, Object 61 instances may manifest supporting structures under or around it to \"justify\" its appearance, such as the pictured trailer.

Unlike many other Object 61 instances, 61.4 has only been documented in this one location; it remained in Lotka Lake until its disappearance on 4/2001. None of the Grandchildren of Lotka claim to have observed Object 61.4's arrival or departure, but they report that <a href=\"/entity-114\">Entity 114</a> was unlikely to have been involved.</span></p><br><p><strong>Object 61.6</strong> is found in a large foyer within the hotel's halls, complete with a number of benches, side tables, and water fountains lining the walls. The object itself is placed upon a stone pedestal and surrounded with stanchion roping and a small plaque describing some noteworthy battles fought by the Royal Danish Navy. Upon the vessel's departure, the foyer reverts to a regular section of hallway.</p><br><p>Of the hotel's staff, only <a href=\"/entity-135\">Entity 135</a> could be reached for comment during the object's stay, expressing notable concern for the object's effect on hallway traffic and for what the hotel's <a href=\"/entity-18\">proprietor</a> would think if he was to come across it.</p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:smaller;\"><strong>Object 61.7</strong> resting at the shore of Level 100, here partially flooded at the level's high tide. Generally, it is assumed that Level 100 is only entered via interaction with the resident Shadow; the appearance of 61.7, likely not due to such an interaction, suggests the existence of alternative points of entry.</span></p><br><p><strong>Object 61.9</strong> is found in a large vaulted natatorium within Level 130, installed with multiple skylights. Structure is assumed to be another manifestation by the object. Object 61.9 is noted to have obtained several meter-long lacerations across its hull.</p><br><p>The pool water the object sits in is stained an uncharacteristic teal, and a number of dark teal stains line the water's edge. Further testing shows that both the pool water and stains contain a quantity of bodily fluid belonging to no documented life-form.</p><br><p><strong>Object 61.9</strong> is found in Level 499, this time having shaped the level's lower catacombs around itself into a partially-flooded cavern. The previously noted lacerations have since disappeared.</p><br><p>A number of reports have subsequently been filed to the M.E.G. expressing concern for a group of Amor Incrementum members trapped in the greater labyrinth, presumably due to Object 61.9's interference. As of 30 July 2019, <a href=\"/the-m-e-g\">Quick Match</a> subregiments Rigel and Arcturus have been dispatched to Level 499 to perform emergency excavations.</p><br><p><strong>Object 61.9</strong> and the previously manifested cavern disappear overnight after five weeks. The area has reverted back to its labyrinthine state, freeing the trapped individuals with no fatalities.</p><br><p>Of the 30 people initially trapped, 28 have escaped with no lasting conditions; the remaining two have been placed into temporary emergency care. Most individuals exhibited temporary symptoms of sensory deprivation and starvation, attributing their survival to the spring and vegetation accessible from their enclosed area of the catacombs.</p><br><p><strong>Object 61.10</strong> is discovered in a seemingly custom-made airlock on the exterior of the <em>Reefwalker</em>, open to the ocean but only flooded enough as to fit the vessel comfortably. This airlock and its entrance to the greater submersible disappear upon the vessel's departure, during which the airlock \"breaks off\" the craft and the vessel itself takes on water and sinks towards the bottom of the seafloor beyond the visibility of any witnesses present.</p><br><p>A number of visitors who were present during Object 61.10's years-long stay claimed the level's internal elevator occasionally displayed complaints about the object's presence.</p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:smaller;\"><strong>Object 61.10</strong> at its closest to the hull of Level 500. According to on-site crew and observers, Object 61.10 did not visibly attempt to steer towards or away from the hull, instead traveling in a straight line alongside the warship while passing by.</span></p><br><p>The last of 22 individual accounts of the presence of <strong>Object 61.11</strong> in Level 826 is anonymously filed into M.E.G. records.<br/>\nFirsthand descriptions of the object and its behaviors are identical to those of Object 61 instances in extant levels, but all make a point to mention the object's position on the edge of the level's bottomless pit, facing the hand in the center.</p><br><p><strong>Object 61.11</strong> is found in the \"Shanty Lands\" sector of Level 230 on 11 January 2022. The object itself exhibits no signs of having warped the surrounding environment to suit itself; however, it is stationed next to what is found to be a doorway to <a href=\"/level-18\">Level 18</a>. Upon investigation the usual collection of bedrooms and classrooms are replaced by a patch of planks and sod floating on an oceanic expanse of cold seawater, further obscured by a constant dense fog.</p><br><p>Utilization of an instance of <a href=\"/object-57\">Object 57</a> produces the following projection, reproduced from the original map for screen visibility.</p><br><p>Investigation of the body of water or the larger island could not be carried out before Object 61.11 migrated from Level 230 on 23 January 2022; it has not been found since. A search of the small floating area accessible from the doorway yielded little more than the occasional scrap of fabric and shard of glassware, dated approximately to the late 19th century.</p><br><p><strong>\u2021</strong></p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/object-60\">Object 60</a> | Object 61 | <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/object-62\">Object 62</a> \u00bb</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/object-61\">Object 61 - Vagrants in Saltwater</a>\" by BUBBLINGBEACH, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

    "description": "<p>The <strong>Madison Street Mannequin</strong> is an old looking mannequin made of plaster with bronze colored skin and a semi-realistic face. It can be seen wearing a tattered suit covered in calcareous and siliceous deposits as if it was left underwater for a long period of time.</p><br><p>When a Wanderer views <strong>The Mannequin</strong>, they experience mild hallucinations. Wanderers report consistently seeing <strong>The Mannequin</strong> in their peripheral vision. This effect can last anywhere from a few days to several years. The mental state of Wanderers have been seen to be negatively affected during this time. It is unknown if this is an effect of the object or just a natural response to the hallucinations.</p><br><p><strong>The Mannequin</strong>'s effects were discovered on December 5th, 2020, when Howard Dunn, a resident of <a href=\"/the-m-e-g\">M.E.G.</a> Base Beta, came into contact with it. Sections of Dunn's personal journal have been included for informational purposes. Superfluous entries have been removed for brevity.</p><br><p><strong>12/5/20</strong></p><br><p>I think the backrooms are finally getting to me. I'm honestly surprised I wasn't really affected until now, but I guess it had to happen sometime. Long story short, I saw this creepy mannequin when I was out exploring some random streets in eleven, and now I keep seeing him out of the corner of my eye. <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">It's almost like he's watching me.</span> I'm sure if I just get a good night's sleep and keep drinking <a href=\"/object-1\">Almond Water</a>, it'll go away, but it's still pretty creepy.</p><br><p><strong>12/6/20</strong></p><br><p><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">He's still there.</span> I could see it in my room when I woke up. I keep telling myself that it isn't real, and I know that's true because it just disappears whenever I try to actually look at <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">him</span> it, but it's really freaking me out. God, I hope this ends soon.</p><br><p><strong>12/13/20</strong></p><br><p>I've been thinking, and I've decided. The most terrible thing that can happen to a person is going insane. Just having every single bit of rational thinking squeezed out of you. It feels so wrong. <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">I</span> You can never be sure what's real, or even who's real. The worst part about it is you can't stop it, no matter how hard you try. I've seen it happen before. Not to anyone I was close to (thank God). <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">I drink all the Almond Water I can, but I'm afraid that it won't be long before I end up like an animal, driven only by fear, or maybe something far <a href=\"/entity-15\">worse</a>.</span> That's kind of a grim thought. I'm sure it won't come to that.</p><br><p><strong>12/18/20</strong></p><br><p>I can't focus anymore. He's always watching me. It's like my brain is fried, and the only clear image is him. It's getting worse every day, and I just can't deal with it. God, I just need to escape. I'm heading out in the morning. Don't try to look for me. I'm sorry.</p><br><p><strong>12/19/20</strong></p><br><p><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">He's gone.</span> I can't believe I'm finally back to normal. I don't really know what I was thinking yesterday. I guess I just snapped. I went out into <a href=\"/level-11-2\">Perdition</a>, and I just had to lay down. It's all a blur, but I think I saw something that looked like a <a href=\"/entity-170\">dragon</a> coming towards me, but I just didn't couldn't move out of the way. I think it would have killed me. When I saw fire coming out of its mouth, something just clicked in me, and I snapped out of whatever haze I was in. I think it would have been too late, but the mannequin appeared between me and the dragon. Like, actually appeared, not some sort of weird hallucination. I it was real this time because it somehow absorbed the fire, giving me enough time to run away. I'm honestly not really sure what happened, or if any of that was even real, but I feel a lot better now.</p><br><p>Now that I'm able to think clearly, I'm sure that what caused this was the mannequin I saw in eleven. I know you can just go crazy from being in the backrooms, but I've never seen it hit anyone that hard. Whatever the case is, I'm not taking any chances. I'm leaving Base Beta tomorrow, and I'm honestly not sure if I'll ever set foot on Level Eleven again. That's probably okay though. I'm sure I'll be more help at <a href=\"/level-46\">Desert Rose</a> anyhow. They could use another pair of hands. I'm going to give these pages to the MEG with the hope that they can destroy him because I don't want anyone else to ever have to go through that shit.

    "title": "Object 66 - \"Leviathan's Tooth\"",
    "description": "<p><strong>Leviathan's Tooth</strong> was originally a hardened clay tablet measured at approximately 75 x 75 x 15\u00a0cm (29 x 29 x 6 in). It was reportedly discovered on an altar at <a href=\"/level-105\">Level 105</a> in June of 2003, but numerous inscriptions on it indicated that it had already been used far earlier, including writings in ancient Semitic dialects and other undetermined languages. Despite its anomalous properties, material analysis performed on a sample has yielded results in line with similar non-anomalous artifacts. Any person who touches the object will immediately gain an inherent understanding of its abilities and the conditions associated with its use. Those who receive this knowledge believe it to be the truth, and while no evidence has ever been found to the contrary, it should still be noted that this qualifies as a potential cognitive hazard. Since it has been reduced to a much smaller chunk of stone, it has only retained the ability to convey information about itself while losing the power to perform its intended function.</p><br><p>The main purpose of <strong>Leviathan's Tooth</strong> is to serve as a method of transport between the Backrooms and the <a href=\"/the-frontrooms\">Frontrooms</a> via instant teleportation. According to the object, it operates under the law of equivalent exchange. In order to attempt a transfer, one must etch both their name and the name of another being into the tablet. A \"judgement\" process will then commence in which the writer's \"love\" for the target is quantified by unknown means. If the \"love\" they possess is deemed to be great enough, they will exit the Backrooms, and their \"loved one\" will be warped from the Frontrooms to an unspecified level. If the exchange is determined to be unacceptable, then a portion of the writer's body will be teleported in accordance with their degree of \"love\", and the target will remain unaffected. This process does not incur any physical trauma, though it is still possible for it to result in expiration if major organs or other vital structures are taken.</p><br><p>Each person is only allowed a single valid attempt, as in the words of the tablet, \"the weight of true names may only be leveraged once\". This stipulation has birthed conjecture on the possibility of initiating multiple attempts by acquiring more than one \"true name\", though how this would be achieved remains inconclusive. It has been confirmed that entering any nicknames or aliases produces an invalid result while still allowing for further tries. Other invalid attempts include naming the deceased, naming a person or entity who is already in the Backrooms, misspellings, and illegible writing. If one\u2019s name has been legally changed, then there is no preference as to whether the maiden or current name is entered, though they are both counted as the same \u201ctrue name\u201d. It is unclear how <strong>Leviathan's Tooth</strong> interacts with those who have definitively abandoned their previous name(s) or those who do not possess what would conventionally be considered a name.</p><br><p><br/>\n<br/>\nThese results were willingly made available by the B.N.T.G. after the existence of <strong>Leviathan's Tooth</strong> was <a href=\"/shattered\">leaked</a>. They have since released most of the information that constitutes this article in tandem with a public bounty on any knowledge that would lead to the discovery of a new tablet. It is plausible that other documentation still exists and is being kept in confidence.</p><br><p>written by ~ <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/snailjail\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7729978); return false;\"><img alt=\"snailjail\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7729978&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334079\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7729978)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/snailjail\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7729978); return false;\">snailjail</a></span></p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/object-66\">Object 66</a>\" by snailjail, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

    "title": "Object 69 - \"Xenon Marbles\"",
    "description": "<p><strong>Xenon Marbles</strong> are small crystal orbs, with an average size of 2.5 centimeters. Although the exact material the orbs are made out of is unknown, it is crystalline in nature and relatively tough. Inside each marble is condensed xenon gas, releasing a bright blue glow. Highly sought after by many people, Xenon Orbs are precious due to their uses and unique properties.</p><br><p>These marbles are vital in the life cycle of <a href=\"/entity-35\">Light Guides</a>. It acts as the \"egg\" for these entities, allowing more to be born. The marble will crack, releasing several Light Guides into the nearby area. Both the object and entity are harmless and pose no danger to wanderers.</p><br><p>The xenon inside has many mechanical purposes, mainly in makeshift lighting. Their size and toughness allows them to be used as projectiles in various devices. Allowing them to break open causes several Light Guides to be released. Light Guides are highly intelligent beings, leading wanderers to various supplies (food, water, equipment, etc.). Light Guides are also able to spontaneously appear and disappear at will. Xenon Marbles are highly valuable due to these uses and are highly coveted by various groups.</p><br><p>Hatching can be prevented by encasing the marble in any material, solid or liquid. Encasing the marbles prevents it from breaking apart and releasing Light Guides. Any substance will work but the most commonly substance used is <a href=\"/object-1\">Almond Water</a>. The current process in which Xenon Marbles form is unknown, but there are several theories:</p><br><p>Xenon Marbles are formed after the death of a <a href=\"/entity-35\">Light Guide</a>. The entity will become encased within the crystal structure and decompose into xenon. This theory is the most plausible as it implies Light Guides complete a full life cycle. This theory brings the physical biology of Light Guides into question. Though they were once thought to be points of light, they may instead be highly condensed xenon gas. This does not explain their sentient behaviors, but may give insight into their structure.</p><br><p>Xenon Marbles are a part of the natural surroundings within a level. Light Guides do not complete a life cycle; instead, they continuously form out of these objects. This implies that Xenon Marbles are a resource comparable to <a href=\"/object-15\">Firesalt</a> and <a href=\"/object-48\">Liquid Pain</a>, forming naturally within levels. This is unlikely, as the amount of Xenon Marbles found is not decreasing, meaning there is constantly more being created.</p><br><p>Xenon Marbles formed within <a href=\"/level-6\">Level 6</a> are the result of crystals forming with small pockets of xenon gas within. This is the least plausible theory, as Xenon Marbles are found outside of <a href=\"/level-6\">Level 6</a>. It could be the reasoning behind some marbles, but not all of them.</p><br><p><strong>Xenon Marbles</strong> are rare across all levels, but are slightly more common in <a href=\"/level-263\">Level 263</a>, <a href=\"/level-6\">Level 6</a>, <a href=\"/level-16\">Level 16</a>, and <a href=\"/level-170\">Level 170</a>. They can be found in many other levels, but this is where the majority of reported instances are found.<br/>\n<br/></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:200%;\"><strong><tt>B.N.T.G.

    "description": "<p>Instances of Object 70 can be identified by their countenance. The appearance of each carcass is that of an unremarkable middle-aged Caucasian male with short, brown hair and black eyes. They lack facial hair though their face is lined with a multitude of dusty wrinkles, the beginning of old age. Every instance of Object 70 has a peaceful, weary expression plastered on its face. A cancerous mole (in its early stages) dots the right side of each body's neck.</p><br><p>All of the corpses are dressed in three-piece suits of varying colourways and styles, the most commonly found outfit being a drab black notch lapel business suit. A plain-vanilla silver band can be found on their right-hand ring finger. In all cases, lest the circumstances around the corpse interfere, the suits are all neat, clean, and evidently ironed-out not long before death. In similar fashion, any shoes the corpse may have on its person are polished.</p><br><p>Each corpse is found with an antique briefcase gripped in its hand. The briefcases will contain commonplace supplies: Lunchboxes containing homemade dinners, stationary, and flasks of water are the most common finds, though each briefcase is a surprise of its own. Lest it has already been looted, one should take advantage of the unattended-to rations. Supplies are sparse out in the open world, and the environment around you will not necessarily be hospitable to your needs.</p><br><p>All attempts at matching the cadavers with any living human being have failed. The corpse lacks fingerprints entirely and the results of all DNA tests are inconclusive. This is the body's only extranormal physiological property, despite all the mystery attached to it. Just like a normal corpse, it withers and disintegrates, leaving nothing but bones behind.</p><br><p>For now, it is impossible to ascertain the possible origin of the corpses and the reason for their appearance throughout The Backrooms. Regardless of what discoveries are and are not made, it is important even in desperate times to be mindful of the departed.</p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/object-69\">Object 69</a> | Object 70 | <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/object-71\">Object 71</a> \u00bb</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/object-70\">Object 70</a>\" by Sariastuff, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

    "title": "Object 75 - \"Chekhov's Gun\"",
    "description": "<p>An example of a typical Mosin-Nagant rifle. Not an actual picture of Chekhov's Gun.</p><br><p><strong>Chekhov\u2019s Gun</strong> takes the appearance of a standard Mosin-Nagant rifle<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup>. The gun is notably pristine, with no scuffs, scratches, or rust found anywhere on it. The most distinctive feature of this weapon is a metal plate on the butt of the gun that has a curious engraving that reads, \u201cA Gift From Anton, 15 July 1904\u201d.</p><br><p><strong>Chekhov\u2019s Gun</strong> only seems to appear when somewhat arbitrary conditions are met, but when it does, it can prove invaluable. <strong>Chekhov\u2019s Gun</strong> seems to only manifest when a wanderer is threatened by an aggressor that will bring them harm, such as an entity or hostile human. Usually, the wanderer that is being threatened will see it at the last second, only having a short window to grab it and defend themselves. On rare occasions, wanderers who are fleeing a threat may find it and wait until their aggressor is within their sights. Regardless of how it manifests, <strong>Chekhov\u2019s Gun</strong> seems to be a rare occurrence, and those that have seen it owe their life to it.</p><br><p>A strange similarity has been found in the reports of every person that has found <strong>Chekhov\u2019s Gun</strong>. Every report indicates that the person who found the gun either feels that the gun is familiar, or they had actually seen the gun in <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-frontrooms\">The Frontrooms</a>. This facet of the object has raised many questions about its connection to The Frontrooms, The Backrooms, and the wanderers who see it. It has been theorized that this gun is a mere manifestation within The Frontrooms due to witnesses indicating that no other person perceived the gun. It is likely that seeing the gun foreshadows one\u2019s entrance into The Backrooms and the gun\u2019s use within The Backrooms. However, why the gun manifests and who it manifests to seems arbitrary.</p><br><p><strong>Chekhov\u2019s Gun</strong> is not a conventional firearm. It has been reported that no ammunition or further operation is required to fire the gun. Furthermore, it has been noted that when fired there is no felt recoil, and no sound or muzzle flash is produced, but, most curiously, when the gun is fired at a target, the target will disappear without a trace. In addition to the target, <strong>Chekhov\u2019s Gun</strong> will disappear from the user\u2019s hands. Where both the target or the gun go after this is unknown.</p><br><p>The inner workings of <strong>Chekhov\u2019s Gun</strong> are unknown due to the short span of time that one usually has the weapon. Nevertheless, it would appear that the weapon compensates for a user\u2019s aim, as reports from people with no firearm experience indicate that they nailed their target despite their shaky aim. All of these aspects make <strong>Chekhov\u2019s Gun</strong> a boon that should be used as soon as the opportunity arises; it may save a life.</p><br><p><strong>Chekhov\u2019s Gun</strong> can theoretically be found on any level, though it is usually found on more dangerous levels, as the conditions to obtain it are tied to a user\u2019s safety.</p><br><p>The first known sighting of <strong>Chekhov\u2019s Gun</strong> was made by a 16 year old boy named Adrian Hardesty who had no-clipped into <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-2\">Level 2</a>. He used <strong>Chekhov\u2019s Gun</strong> to defend himself from a Skin-Stealer. The following interview was conducted with this individual after the fact:</p><br><p><strong>Time:</strong> 3:46 PM<br/>\n<strong>Date:</strong> December 10th, 2022.<br/>\n<strong>Location:</strong> Level 1, Base Alpha.<br/>\n<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Greg Stone<br/>\n<strong>Interviewee:</strong> Adrian Hardesty<br/>\n[Adrian sits opposite of Greg, looking uncomfortable with the interview. Greg seems to be unfazed by his seemingly uncomfortable state.]<br/>\n<strong>Greg:</strong> Hello, it was Adrian Hardesty, correct?<br/>\n<strong>Adrian:</strong> Yeah.<br/>\n<strong>Greg:</strong> Alright, I just want to ask you a few questions about this strange gun you found in Level 2.<br/>\n<strong>Adrian:</strong> Sure, just make it quick, I don\u2019t really like answering a bunch of questions.<br/>\n<strong>Greg:</strong> Great, first, what was happening when you found this gun?<br/>\n<strong>Adrian:</strong> I was in that horrible place with the pipes when I saw a\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026 a monster or something? It looked human at first but I could tell it wasn't. I ran away but I could hear it getting closer. As it got closer to where I was, I saw a gun just laying on the floor. I thought it was my only option, even though I have never even fired a gun before. My hands were shaking with fear, and as the monster came into my sights, I pulled the trigger and the monster, and the gun, were both gone. I'm not sure I even hit it, and don\u2019t guns usually make a really loud noise? I didn\u2019t hear a thing when I pulled the trigger.<br/>\n<strong>Greg:</strong> Very interesting. Indeed, you should have heard the gun going off. Lucky you that it didn\u2019t make a sound, it likely would have attracted more entities or even damaged your ears in such a confined space like Level 2.<br/>\n<strong>Adrian:</strong> Huh, I guess I am lucky then.<br/>\n[Adrian seems to contemplate for a second as Greg writes in a journal.]<br/>\n<strong>Greg:</strong> Ok, can you tell me what this gun looked like? Do you know what kind of gun it is?<br/>\n<strong>Adrian:</strong> I don\u2019t know anything about guns, why are you asking me?<br/>\n<strong>Greg:</strong> I understand, but any information could be helpful.<br/>\n<strong>Adrian:</strong> I guess it had wood on it, it looked old for sure, but it was clean. I don\u2019t really know what else to say about it. I\u2019m sorry if that\u2019s not very helpful. But thinking about it, I swear I\u2019ve seen it before. Wait, I remember, I was with my dad, he was doing something in a pawn shop, I\u2019m not sure what. Anyway, when I looked around at stuff in the shop, I saw a gun on display. I tried to point it out to my dad, but he ignored me while talking to the person behind the counter. I think it was the very same one I saw in uh\u2026 Level 2.<br/>\n<strong>Greg:</strong> Huh, interesting, you say you saw this gun within The Frontrooms? That is quite a revelation. I will make sure this info reaches my superiors, this could be a breakthrough discovery.<br/>\n<strong>Adrian:</strong> \u201cThe Frontrooms\u201d? You mean Earth, right? Whatever. is that all?<br/>\n<strong>Greg:</strong> I think that is all we need for now, thank you for your cooperation.<br/>\n[Greg opens the door for Adrian and both leave the interview room.]</p><br><p>Written by<br/>\n<span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/derrick770\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(8372583); return false;\"><img alt=\"Derrick770\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=8372583&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334085\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=8372583)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/derrick770\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(8372583); return false;\">Derrick770</a></span><br/>\nImage licensed under CC0\u00a01.0, taken by The Swedish Army Museum.</p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/object-74\">Object 74</a> | Object 75 | <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/object-76\">Object 76</a> \u00bb</p><br>",

    "description": "<p>The Involuntarily Portable Radio is a standard issue portable radio with seemingly no brand other than the letter \"Q\" painted on the right side. The radio does not have a dial to change frequency,<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> and only ever broadcasts one channel, a seemingly long-running talk show known as \"Talking With Quinoa\". More details on these broadcasts are disclosed below.</p><br><p>This radio appears to materialize spontaneously on random levels, always doing so in an area populated by humans but never within anyone's line of sight. Witnesses have reported it appearing behind their backs, around a corner, or on the other side of a closed door.</p><br><p>Upon being noticed by a human, the radio will play a broadcast from the aforementioned \"Talking With Quinoa\" for roughly 30 to 120 seconds. When the broadcast is over, the radio will remain silent until it is out of eyesight, at which point it will disappear and reappear elsewhere within 1 to 72 hours. As of now, it is believed that there is only one instance of this object.</p><br><p>The titular \"Quinoa\" who hosts the show appears to have a uniquely scattered worldview. His knowledge of any given topic is limited and often incorrect. Episodes of \"Talking With Quinoa\" are usually nonsensical and disjointed, with very few reoccurring topics between broadcasts. Past talking points have included a ranking of rock-based materials based on how \"crunchy\" they are, dating advice, seances, and a discussion of the merits of cannibalism.</p><br><p>It is of note that \"Quinoa\" has never been seen or heard from outside of broadcasts. No accounts of in-person encounters have been confirmed to be legitimate.</p><br><p>This object was first discovered on <a href=\"/level-2\">Level 2</a> by an anonymous wanderer. When asked further to describe the experience, the witness stated: \"I don't really know. I turned around, and it was there. The show came on for, like, 30 seconds, and then I turned around, and it was gone again. That's all I can really tell you.\"</p><br><p>The following is a series of transcripts of \"Talking With Quinoa\" broadcasts. Additional notes will be added as necessary.

    "title": "Instrument 80 - \"Retributors\"",
    "description": "<p><em>Retributors</em> are spiritual devices used only within the Eyes of Argos as both weapons for defense and tools for dealing justice. The devices differ from traditional projectile-based weapons in the sense that they harm both the spirit of their users and the flesh of their target. For example: should one use a Retributor to shoot another individual in the leg, their own leg will feel the pain of that impact, albeit to a slightly lesser extent.</p><br><p>The coat of an Argos member sporting a newly-summoned Retributor.</p><br><p>Mechanically speaking, Retributors carry the design philosophies of certain black-powder weaponry. They are light and compact, with a tight accuracy that compensates for a low rate of fire. The damage which a Retributor is capable of dealing depends on the constitutional strength of their operator\u2014 a weaker willed man will not strike as powerfully.</p><br><p>Retributors blur the definition between the living and the dead, somehow holding a physical form <em>and</em> being intangible in nature. To first use a Retributor one must \"summon\" one via their own willpower, a feat which can prove difficult to those unaccustomed to their ways.</p><br><p>The weapons don\u2019t need to be repaired or maintained, and their physical form is directly sustained by the soul of their user, which, accordingly, means that the weapon can be a great burden on the spiritual stability of the ones who wield it.</p><br><p><em>\"I saw the man channel his spirit, and conjure it via flame. I couldn't tell what kind of threat I was facing, but I knew that it would be king amidst the Backrooms.\"</em></p><br><p>\u2014 A wanderer describing an firsthand encounter against a Retributor.</p><br><p>Argos initially brought the Retributors to the higher ranks of The Eyes in hopes of redefining the way in which we promulgate our justice. Since their introduction, the instruments have been passed down to most higher-ranking watchers and a few worthy initiates. Once a watcher is bestowed with a Retributor, they form an inexorable bond, although they can be taken away from anyone at The Council's discretion in exceptional cases.</p><br><p>The method in which Argos conjured the devices into being remains unknown\u2014 all we truly know is that it is his will that allows them to be in our possession. Each Retributor is unique and made to specifically accommodate to the strengths and weaknesses of its future user. As the watcher becomes more proficient with their weapon, and grows accustomed to its use, the Retributor may slightly adapt to the preferences of its user.

    "description": "<p><strong>MVCs</strong> are a common object found on most if not all Levels of The Backrooms. They appear as needed and will typically be passive and non-hostile. Their brand name is Backroom Robotics\u2122, which may suggest that they were made specifically by this unknown company. Their function is assumedly to clean the many floors or carpets inside of the backrooms. They will go after any waste found around The Backrooms. Due to The Backrooms nature they have been noted to have some strange properties.</p><br><p>If any attempts are made to attack, dismantle, or otherwise harm <strong>MVCs</strong>, they have been noted to be capable of self-defense. Their most common self defense mechanism consists of turning towards their aggressor and proceeding to engulf a body part. They then cut off this body part with a built in set of metal teeth. After this, they continue this process until their aggressor is neutralized. They then will finish off engulfing the aggressor. When necessary, they are capable of shooting out excess debris picked up around the backrooms, typically using sharper items. They only use this attack pattern if their aggressor is farther away than their engulfing range. After successfully weakening their aggressor, they will then engulf them in a manner similar to their primary defense mechanism.</p><br><p>The inside of any <strong>MVC</strong> will resemble a plastic container, matching the container itself exactly. The walls of the <strong>MVC</strong>, as well as the floor, are all plastic. If the container is used to create a Worn Sack, it will resemble the material of the Worn Sack itself.</p><br><p>All entities that come into contact with the <strong>MVCs</strong> will ignore them. It appears Entities can touch it, but will not notice the <strong>MVC</strong>. If any wanderer attempts to use an <strong>MVC</strong> against an Entity, the Entity will ignore the <strong>MVC</strong> and instead attack the wanderer.</p><br><p>It is possible to disable an <strong>MVC</strong>, though doing so requires specific tools. For example, using Firearms have been known to be incredibly useful in breaking an <strong>MVC</strong>. Though any part of an <strong>MVC</strong> can be considered vulnerable, the middle of the top tends to be a vulnerable spot. Once broken, the materials used to make the vacuum can all be reused. However, instead of having a standard container for debris, it has a small pocket dimension similar to a single-story house.</p><br><p>The pocket dimensions are from an unknown location, although the most likely explanation is that Backroom Robotics\u2122 created these pocket dimensions in order to have a secure place for <strong>MVC</strong> debris storage. These Pocket Dimensions are very secure, and have not been noted to ever shift or break. They all have air ducts, which all seem to connect to very obscure locations on <a href=\"/level-1\">Level 1</a>. There are no other objects inside the <strong>MVC's</strong>, other then the objects already engulfed by the <strong>MVC</strong>. The amount of space inside of an MVC is 1400 meters cubed, with variation being only noticed within damaged <strong>MVC's</strong>.</p><br><p>When utilized properly, you can use these pocket dimension to create a <a href=\"/object-87\">Worn Sack</a>. Worn Sacks are small backpacks which are capable of storing very large amounts of storage. To create a Worn Sack, a debris container from an <strong>MVC</strong> is required.</p><br><p><strong>MVCs</strong> appear as needed; therefore, it is recommended to drop a small amount of debris to catch them. The best debris to drop is any container which once held Almond Water. Avoid floors that are highly dangerous and have high entity counts, such as <a href=\"/level-6\">Level 6</a>. If you use these floors, it will take longer for an <strong>MVC</strong> to appear. Be sure to carry a suitable tool for breaking the <strong>MVC</strong>. The best tool to use would be a Firearm, though any large blunt object, such as a hammer, works when used properly. As it is challenging to handle the small pocket dimension, it is recommended you seek an expert in developing Worn Sacks in order to obtain a Worn Sack.</p><br><p><span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/yellowislol\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6284593); return false;\"><img alt=\"YellowISlol\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=6284593&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334085\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=6284593)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/yellowislol\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6284593); return false;\">YellowISlol</a></span></p><br><p>\u00ab <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/object-82\">Object 82</a> | Object 83 | <a href=\"/object-84\">Object 84</a> \u00bb</p><br>",

    "description": "<p>Object 84, photographed in Level 19.</p><br><p><strong>Object 84</strong>, colloquially known as <strong>LiberTV</strong> by its viewers, is an old television reminiscent of the early models popularized during the height of the twentieth century. According to witnesses, the sole channel on the television is Channel 84, which constantly airs commercials for non-existent products such as red sunglasses, everlasting candles, and glass sieves. Though no flowers are present near the object, those who have interacted with <strong>LiberTV</strong> have reported smelling a fragrance similar to dying roses. On top of the TV is a copy of Aldous Huxley\u2019s <em>Brave New World</em>.</p><br><p>The entire object, including the book, is made of malleable clay that molds when pressure is applied to it and returns to its original form when that pressure is released. Because of this, none of the buttons or dials work\u2014the TV turns on when it senses a human in the vicinity and off when it does not. It is not recommended, however, to touch <strong>Object 84</strong>; on contact, it has been known to cause burn injuries and flood the mind with pointless commercials. The distracting commercials usually make wanderers unaware of their pain reflex, thus allowing the TV to inflict more damage.</p><br><p><strong>Incoming Transmission:</strong></p><br><p>Tired of all the knowledge slipping away from your fingertips?</p><br><p>Do you want to keep in those fine bits, those small specks?</p><br><p>Those unimportant, minute details?</p><br><p>We here at <strong>Filter</strong> have solved all your problems\u2014</p><br><p>Introducing\u2026</p><br><p>The Glass Sieve.</p><br><p>It's transparent, effective, and\u2026 fragile!</p><br><p>Unlike other sieves, our product has no holes whatsoever, so you can retain everything you catch!</p><br><p>As long as you don't break it, our sieve acts as a makeshift container for all your storage needs!</p><br><p>No more \"bad\" stuff or \"good\" stuff. It's all equally harvested, equally distributed.</p><br><p>In fact, we'll add in a second device to remove all those giant clumps, the foundations of rocks!</p><br><p>Soon, you'll be left with what you wanted\u2014millions of specks of disconnected grains.</p><br><p>All jumbled up, unable to join together to form anything cohesive.</p><br><p>And if you call now, this mess could be yours today!</p><br><p>Call 1-451-800-2953.</p><br><p>That's 1-451-800-1953.</p><br><p>Call now!</p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:0.7em;\">(<strong>Filter</strong> is not responsible for any psychosis caused by repeated usage of this product. Proceed with caution.)</span></p><br><p>The commercials are generally nonsensical and absurd, but despite this, <strong>LiberTV</strong> has a propensity to hook viewers in for hours with its consumerist propaganda. Many viewers have described the commercials as hypnotic and manipulative, with a subtle, foreboding tone. If wanderers watch the TV for long enough, they will be left in a catatonic state, completely immobile until they snap out of their trance. These victims frequently develop permanent inflammation around the eyes and vision loss, having not blinked in hours. In severe cases, victims may neglect their own bodily needs, dying of starvation with their eyes still locked on <strong>Object 84</strong>.</p><br><p>Its brainwashing properties have been largely analyzed, though the long-term effects remain unknown. <a href=\"/the-m-e-g\">M.E.G.</a> researchers have been unable to come up with a possible motive for the brainwashing. It has been proven, however, that victims' cognitive abilities irreversibly decrease as a result of prolonged exposure to <strong>LiberTV</strong>. Though many wanderers have claimed that <strong>LiberTV</strong> is secretly a mind-control entity, no tangible evidence has supported this theory.</p><br><p>Because it has been reported that hundreds of commercials exist, each advertising a different product, the M.E.G. has unfortunately been unable to analyze every single broadcast. However, in an attempt to study the absurdity of the commercials and create possible solutions to their brainwashing effects, the M.E.G. has released a <a href=\"/object-84-supplementary-document\">community-centered advertisement log</a> so wanderers can help transcribe the commercials seen on <strong>LiberTV</strong>.</p><br><p><strong>Preface:</strong> Regardless of whatever commercial Object 84 is currently airing, touching Object 84 will burn the wanderer who dares to touch it, and the current commercial will immediately switch to this one about the \"Everlasting Candle,\" which plays until the wanderer takes their hand off.</p><br><p><strong>Incoming Transmission:</strong></p><br><p>There's nothing more comforting than a light in the tunnel.</p><br><p>Whether you're trapped, confused, or just downright disoriented, everyone wants a guide.</p><br><p>Look no further, because this flame will never flicker out.</p><br><p>Traverse the darkness with your new friend, the Everlasting Candle.</p><br><p>It'll act as your savior in times of need.</p><br><p>It'll steer you to that bright light in the distance.</p><br><p>It'll be your only source of order in a void filled with chaos.</p><br><p>Call 1-911-225-4984 to start your free trial today.</p><br><p>All you need to do is let go and allow the candle to work its magic.</p><br><p>Let go, my dear, and let it happen.</p><br><p>Let go.</p><br><p>You know, I genuinely didn't think much of this thing at first\u2014it's just a TV in an <a href=\"/level-19\">attic</a>. What's so abnormal about that? Watching TV is something everyone does in their childhood; no one questions the information being spewed out until it contradicts with their own beliefs. However, it's all a ruse, if I'm being honest. I felt a sharp headache while watching the channel, yet some inner voice in my head encouraged me to keep watching, because the \"show hadn't hit its climax yet.\" It was hurting me, but I just felt some obligation to ignore the pain while pursuing entertainment. This small little parasite was producing a major effect on my brain, but I was trapped in my own mind, unable to break free.</p><br><p><strong>Incoming Transmission:</strong></p><br><p>Are you stuck in a dysfunctional conversation that's going nowhere?</p><br><p>Can't stand to look your partner in the eye out of sheer hate?</p><br><p>Well, now you won't have to with our red sunglasses, coated in lead-based paint!</p><br><p>This product will act as the ultimate barrier between you and the other person!</p><br><p>Just put them on, and voil\u00e0, you're now blind to your surroundings.</p><br><p>Can't stand them?

This fruit possesses multiple unique attributes that have not been seen in any other similar species; it still carries the physical traits of citrus, resembling a red, average-sized lemon with a distinct smell of alcohol and strawberries. This product is currently very popular among residents of <a href=\"/level-194\">Asset 194</a>, as the fruit is grown strictly on this level.</p><br><p>Nutrition Facts (Due to incompetent team members' mistakes, please note that the total sugar is not, in fact, 8 grams, and is instead 46 grams.)</p><br><p>Agrugua has a wide variety of positives when consumed, the main effect being its incredible healing capabilities. When the fruit is consumed, any small illnesses such as headaches, stomachaches, or sore throat will become gradually better, with the healing process taking around 20 minutes to fully complete; the process has been often detailed to make the consumer feel \"tingly\" and \"warm inside\".

See the wave propulsor.</p><br><p><tt>fig 1.1</tt> Photograph of Asset 86's mechanism by a Backrooms Robotics mechanic.</p><br><p><strong>Asset 86</strong>, unofficially the <strong>Reality Lag Machine</strong>, is a powerful, manually operated wave propulsor capable of \"deleting\" reality, or causing it to cease to exist, with oscillating negative waves strong enough to interfere with the base nature of everything, temporarily ceasing everything to exist before subsisting to normal reality again, then ceasing existence once more in a rhythmic pattern in response to the propulsor's designated negative wave output, essentially deleting time and space. At the same time, it reemerges into existence through mass and energy or quantum waves.</p><br><p>The intensity of delays between deletion and reemergence increases the higher the NHz is, prolonging inexistences between each deletion and reemergence, thus resulting in even more delay. Theoretically, with a powerful enough negative wave output, the permanent cessation of reality\u2014and by extension\u2014existence, and everything, is possible.</p><br><p><strong>Asset 86</strong> is powered by a negative wave source called <strong>\"Cataclysm Nucleus\"</strong>,<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')\">3</a></sup> an outbursting and levitating plasmic-like spheroid core of extremely densified negative waves encased within a tesseract structure made of an unknown, durable translucent material.</p><br><p>The remarkably difficult procurement of such a source of the negative waves is still unknown to most staff and personnel of Backrooms Robotics, with strict corporate bounds to its origin. The nucleus is stored within a superlatively densified and pressurized stasis chamber<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-4\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')\">4</a></sup> behind the conoidal ring at the back of the wave propulsor, negative waves are then sifted thoroughly through a large pipe located at the bottom of the propulsor (see <tt>fig 1.1</tt>) where most of the energy coming from each oscillation of the propulsor comes from.</p><br><p>The engine above this pipe mostly limits NHz outputs so as not to overuse and overheat the asset, and the rest of the mechanisms are automatic cooling systems for when necessary predicaments arise.</p><br><p>In order to test the capabilities of <strong>Asset 86</strong>, <strong>PROJECT LEAD</strong> has put in effect extensive testing procedures for the device.<br/></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:120%;\"><strong><tt><span style=\"color: #90ee90\">Effective 06/25/2022</span></tt></strong></span></p><br><p><tt><strong>Date:</strong> 06/26/2022, 05:00 AM</tt><br/>\n<tt><strong>Input:</strong> Pulse 2.0 NHz to Reality</tt></p><br><p><iframe allowtransparency=\"true\" class=\"html-block-iframe\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"/object-86/html/e6e61bea0eeb49ff817d20c3a4086af9b528fd5a-579018880514283695\"></iframe></p><br><p><tt><strong>Result:</strong> Reality ceases 0.5 seconds per cancellation.

    "description": "<p>A <strong>Worn Sack</strong> is a bag that can be made using a <a href=\"/object-83\">Mobile Vacuum Cleaner</a>'s (MVCs) debris container. In order to create a <strong>Worn Sack</strong>, you must first have a bag that has been used to a \"worn state.\" A worn state typically means a state where the bag has been used to a point of looking different from when it was first made. A worn state typically requires the following:</p><br><p>Though the bag must be in a worn state, there appears to be a limit to how worn it can be. The following have been observed to be \"over-worn\":</p><br><p>Once you have a suitable bag, you must then obtain the container used by MVCs to store debris. In order to obtain one, simply locate an MVC, then dismantle it and obtain its debris container.</p><br><p>Once acquired, there is a very difficult process involved in order to create a <strong>Worn Sack</strong>. There are multiple known groups capable of making <strong>Worn Sacks</strong>, though they keep their processes secret, and have been known to get violent when attempts are made to learn.</p><br><p><strong>Worn Sacks</strong> are highly valued containers within The Backrooms. This is due to the large amount of storage space within the <strong>Worn Sack</strong>. The space inside of a <strong>Worn Sack</strong> is around 700 meters cubed. The weight will always be 0.5 pounds, no matter how much is stored inside the sack. <strong>Worn Sacks</strong> are known to be made with special convective currents, allowing them circulate air at a rate being breathable. Due to this, you are able to stay in a <strong>Worn Sack</strong> for around 1 hour before experiencing hypoxia. The walls inside of a <strong>Worn Sack</strong>, as well as the floor, resemble the material of the <strong>Worn Sack</strong> itself. This means if a bag is made of textile covering, the entirety of the inside of a <strong>Worn Sack</strong> will be made of textile covering. To exit, just imagine an exit, and leave, you will appear right next to the spot where you last placed your <strong>Worn Sack</strong>, with it on your back.</p><br><p>This group is very mysterious group, though it has been confirmed that they were once part of the Backrooms National Trade Group. They hold many secrets, and they don't appear to have a base of any kind. They can be found wandering any Level which is somewhat safe, and they have access to weaponry to defend themselves. They are most commonly identifiable my the marking on their hands, which has been said to resemble an axe and a heart. Due to this marking, they can commonly be seen wearing white gloves worn by butlers. If recognized, they will stay passive unless provoked. If a good enough deal is struck, they will be willing to trade to make a <strong>Worn Sack</strong>. Their price is typically low, mostly consisting of basic survival needs, such as food and water.</p><br><p>Many members of The Lost are capable of making <strong>Worn Sacks</strong>. They are not open to trading, however, meaning that it is very difficult to obtain a <strong>Worn Sack</strong> from this group. If you manage to gain the trust of any member with knowledge of <strong>Worn Sacks</strong>, they may be willing. For a much more risky alternative, some members of The Lost would be willing to make a <strong>Worn Sack</strong> for you if you threaten them. However, you cannot threaten them into showing you how to make a <strong>Worn Sack</strong>, and attempts to do will prove futile.</p><br><p>This man can be seen wandering any floor that has to do with Asian Culture or the night. He is quite friendly when approached. However, he can be hostile when provoked, and seems to be adept in many forms of combat. He is willing to make <strong>Worn Sacks</strong>, and will rarely charge you.</p><br><p>A very old woman, she spends her time knitting on <a href=\"/level-98\">Level 98</a>. If you approach her with the necessary materials to make a <strong>Worn Sack</strong>, she will invite you to sit down. After talking to you for a while about small topics, such as weather, she will begin to sing a random lullaby. After inevitably falling asleep, you will awake to find yourself having a <strong>Worn Sack</strong> and a small pocket knife. Siphylis will be sitting in a different booth, knitting once more. She seems to have very little knowledge, however, she does have some connection to <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/the-kitchen\">The Kitchen</a>.</p><br><p>Very little is known about Mortimer, his motivations, or his identity. He will sometimes be seen on any of the rooms on Level 4, though he sometimes can be found in the <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/anti-reality-bowling-alley\">Anti-Reality Bowling Alley</a>. How he gets to these places is unknown, as he has never been sighted on Level 4 or Level 178. He will be willing to make you a <strong>Worn Sack</strong> if you are capable of solving a random question, typically related to Voronoi Diagrams. If you are incapable of answering, he will simply state \"Maybe for another time then.\" After stating this, you will pass out for 3 hours, awakening in the same place.

Most commonly found on <a href=\"/level-178-1\">Level 178.1</a>, however, they can be found on virtually any level suitable for humans. A rare sighting has confirmed they are capable of accessing secret levels, such as Level Fun=), <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/level-dead\">Level Dead</a>, and even <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/level-i\">Level i</a>. When asked to make a <strong>Worn Sack</strong>, they will make one around 70% of the time. Whenever they don't, they will simply state they aren't up for it at the moment. When they do, your eyes will suddenly blink, no matter how hard you attempt to keep your eyes open. If you lack eyelids, you will simply have static vision for a moment. When opened, a <strong>Worn Sack</strong> will appear in front of you.</p><br><p>A female German Shepherd, who can be seen wandering <a href=\"/level-241\">Level 241</a>, though she lives in <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/coco-s-bedroom\">Coco's bedroom</a>. Whenever approached with materials required for a <strong>Worn Sack</strong>, the dog will plead for the materials. If given, she will pick both up and walk out of sight, if followed, she will begin to run, and will speed up constantly, until out of sight. Once out of sight, she will disappear, then reappear walking back with a <strong>Worn Sack</strong> around 26 hours later. If you're in a room with no doorways, and under camera surveillance, the cameras will cut out, and she will appear behind you.</p><br><p>A boy aged around 17, who will only answer to his name, Zarien the Awesome Kid.

He is most commonly found on Level 6.1, though will also go to <a href=\"/level-11\">Level 11</a> occasionally. When encountered, he will ramble on about random topics which interest him, and is known for being extremely blunt with his words and phrases. He will actively insult others to them, causing many to be provoked. However, he is very skilled in combat, and if necessary, he can easily neutralize any opponent. When certain words are stated directly to him, he will enter an \"active state.\" One of these phrases include stating <strong>\"Worn Sack\"</strong> In front of him. When stated, everyone in the nearby vicinity will pass out for exactly one hour. This includes anyone who has direct line of sight with him. Near immediately, Milian will make a <strong>Worn Sack</strong>, but only if the materials are available directly. Milian will then disappear and reappear in a random location on the same Level.

When asked to make a <strong>Worn Sack</strong>, he will ask for the materials, and bury them underneath the plastic. He will then walk off. Once dug back up, a <strong>Worn Sack</strong> will be in the hole. He appears incredibly rarely, and can only be sighted by one person at a time. Any people who provoke him go missing, for unknown reasons.</p><br><p>For unknown reason, The Artist is capable of painting a <strong>Worn Sack</strong>, however, she will only paint one if the materials are given to her.

    "description": "<p>Light wires are types of cables found within the Backrooms. They have various functional capabilities through transmitting or receiving electromagnetic wavelengths of light.</p><br><p>Translucent Wires are a type of flexible fiber optic cable found attached to walls and ceilings. They function by sending information via impulses of infrared light with specific temporal intervals. Dissimilar to normal optical fibers, any light passing through will internally reflect independently at any given angle. These wires each have a radius of 1 centimeter (~0.3 in.) and can transmit data between two points in an instant. Unusually, some cables have been reported to connect to other levels within the Backrooms, as some conveyed information from these wires can be received across different levels.</p><br><p>Translucent Wires receiving data from light.</p><br><p>These wires are usually connected to technological devices and can be used to transfer directives and messages to local computers by creating an algorithm. The likelihood of the wire being attached to two separate computers is remote, but possible in a few circumstances. Data can still be successfully dispatched during offline instances and can travel over prolonged distances. Due to their advantageous properties, Translucent Wires are frequently used for offline communication; however, receiving responses from other wanderers is unusual because of their high dispersity. It is crucial to maintain certain protocols, as astute entities have often been reported being able to use digital systems connected to these wires.</p><br><p>Unlike Translucent Cables, Blue Wires cannot transmit any data; rather, they output light systematically. The wire consists of an attenuated pliable glass cable encased within a thick insulator often theorized to be plastic, as a consequence of their similar flexibility and longevity.</p><br><p>Blue light coming from the wire theorized to be a cause of Cherenkov radiation.</p><br><p>Blue Wires are often mistaken to be Translucent Wires due to their similar appearances; despite this, one must never approach the cable's aperture within 3 meters (9.1 feet) distance. Blue Wires have often been witnessed emitting a concentrated beam with a mixture of violet and blue light, as they produce an unprecedented amount of radiation. It has been compared to the amount of damage inflicted by a gamma-ray burst but in a confined area. However, exposure to beams emitted from Blue Wires has been shown to cause minimal side effects due to radiation causing total destruction of genetic code, killing all susceptible cells within a macroscopic area. These cables are often seen to maintain full functionality subsequent to being cut; however, they are frequently witnessed to malfunction after an uncertain amount of time.</p><br><p>The purpose of its existence and utilization is unknown. However, it is deemed to be an acceptable tool for eliminating perilous skin infections and certain pathogenic entities.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> Sources of radiation are theorized to be a cause of an abundance of different radioisotopes; however, this cannot be determined currently.</p><br><p>Warped Wires act similarly to virtual particles<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup> and are rarely seen within the Backrooms. They are often reported to vanish within seconds of contact, then reappear in a different and random location within a level. Due to the total extended perimeter of the cable, there are questions about whether it should be classified as a type of Light Cable.</p><br><p>These wires contort the space around them, causing visual distortions to everything surrounding their perimeter. If distance is not properly maintained, one can be pulled into the opening of the tube due to high suction force caused by unknown factors. Currently, it cannot be determined what Warped Wires are. They are often thought of as a type of transient transportation device between spatial dimensions due to their identical features with wormholes. This hypothesis is conventional and is theorized to be true to an extent. Due to the permanent cessation of communication following suction into the wires, the tangible location present on the other side is ambiguous. While Translucent Wires have been used to try and prolong contact duration, they seem to be repelled by a metaphysical force when in close proximity. Electromagnetism is widely thought to cause this repulsion, thus leading to the belief that all light wires contain some assortment of electrical current. As a result, there have been many unique and diverse ideas about how to utilize these wires.</p><br><p>An experiment was conducted to witness the behavior of Warped Wires when coming in contact with the radioactive light from Blue Wires. The conclusion has confirmed the existence of a potential higher-dimensional space beyond the Warped Cables; this indicates that these transitory wires are intrinsically related to wormholes, capable of creating shortcuts to inaccessible spatial regions.</p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Subject:</strong> Object 90; Blue Wires and Warped Wires.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Procedure:</strong> Two individuals in charge of the study were assigned to explore the unending, segmented rooms of Level 1 until finding an instance of a Warped Wire. Prior to the main event, a sample of Blue Wires had been retrieved by M.E.G. regiment personnel which ultimately became the primary tool for this experiment.<br/>\nAn instance of Warped Wires was discovered after four to five hours of heavy exploring. The two members followed the usual safety protocols by keeping a 15 meter distance away from the aperture of the Warped Cable. The light was quickly shined into the opening.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Results:</strong> After seconds of contact, a small, distinctive holographic image was displayed, presumably depicting the other point in spacetime of the Warped Wire. A closer examination of the image using cheap binoculars revealed a restricted space resembling a set of different liminal spaces, theorized to be the collection of all Backrooms levels. Both members later proclaimed to have sighted the Blue Channel being a subset of the spatial dimension they witnessed, potentially indicating that Warped Wires are subtly linked with a higher dimension that transcends the 4th<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')\">3</a></sup>. Any objects that have fallen into the abyss have documented to dematerialize and vanish, however, it is often thought to be the cause of them entering a dimensional axis that cannot be viewed from the 3rd dimension. In order to ensure safety, no wanderers should be allowed to enter these cables until further public information becomes available.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Analysis:</strong> It is unknown how the interaction between the two wires caused the projected images, but they are thought to be the cause of the wavelengths desynchronizing after reflecting off the Warped Wires, making the light more dispersed. Additionally, the repellent force experienced when these cables are close to one another is hypothesized to play an important role; however, this has yet to be determined.</p><br><p>Translucent Wires: <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:A_bunch_of_optic_fibres_made_of_plastic.JPG\">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:A_bunch_of_optic_fibres_made_of_plastic.JPG</a><br/>\nLicensed Under: CC-BY SA 4.0<br/>\nAuthor: Amangeldyurazov</p><br><p>Blue Wires:<br/>\n<a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:1_Million_Ytterbium_Atoms_Illuminated_by_a_Blue_Laser_(5940299799).jpg\">Here.</a><br/>\nWork is within the public domain.</p><br><p>Written By: <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/riemannhypothesis\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7754667); return false;\"><img alt=\"RiemannHypothesis\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7754667&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334085\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7754667)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/riemannhypothesis\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7754667); return false;\">RiemannHypothesis</a></span> /FoodPieIntegration</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/object-90\">Object 90</a>\" by RiemannHypothesis, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

    "description": "<p><strong>A member of the SpeedNoclippers utilizing a pair of ClipSkips.</strong></p><br><p><strong>ClipSkips</strong> are not just mere running shoes, they are technological marvels designed to revolutionize the way <em>we</em> move <em>and</em> no-clip. The shoes' sleek, blue design, along with white, black, and/or other light shades of blue, evokes an alluring visual that captures the attention of onlookers. Remarkably, what is most astounding is their weightlessness, a feature that defies the natural expectations of such an invention. Upon further examination, it becomes clear that these shoes feature advanced technology designed to analyze and understand the wearer's movements. This smart system is integrated within the shoes to collect data on the user's gait(s) and adjust accordingly to provide optimal fit and comfort.</p><br><p>The <strong>ClipSkips</strong> themselves bear a striking resemblance to conventional <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-frontrooms\">Frontrooms</a> footwear, with their design combining various materials.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> It has been suggested that the materials were sourced from <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-11\">Level 11</a>, where they were gathered and repurposed for this specific application. Furthermore, the SpeedNoclippers have somehow managed to imbue the shoes with an otherworldly blue glow, further adding to their aesthetic appeal.</p><br><p>To protect their invention from counterfeits, the SpeedNoclippers have stamped their logo as an irremovable copyright sticker on the heel of all <strong>ClipSkips</strong> shoes. This firm declaration has made it clear to groups like the <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/b-n-t-g\">B.N.T.G.</a> that <em>any</em> replication will not be tolerated.</p><br><p>Every single pair of <strong>ClipSkips</strong> is meticulously crafted by hand by the group's artisans. As each pair is completed, it is packed in a shoebox sporting the same vivid blue hue, proudly labeled with the signature <em>\"ClipSkips\"</em> logo. Within the box, nestled atop the <strong>ClipSkips</strong> lies an instruction manual by the SpeedNoclippers. The content of the instruction manual reads as follows:</p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:110%;\"><strong>INSTRUCTION MANUAL</strong></span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:105%;\"><strong>(read or risk death)</strong></span></p><br><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Object Introduction:</strong></span><br/>\n<strong>ClipSkips</strong> are essentially an innovative new shoe technology designed to facilitate efficient and risk-free travel through physical barriers (e.g., any exit within a level, to effortlessly jumping through a wall into your friend's room on the other side, etc). Upon donning the <strong>ClipSkips</strong>, users can seamlessly navigate through walls with ease, all while avoiding any damage or injury that would typically result from such actions. Indeed, the <strong>ClipSkips</strong> possess a unique ability to \"absorb\" the reaction force upon impact and convert it into propulsion force, enabling users to effortlessly no-clip through obstructions with minimal effort or risk. For journeys that require navigating through walls or other impediments, <strong>ClipSkips</strong> are an indispensable tool that ensures safe and efficient travel without compromising the user's safety or well-being.</p><br><p><strong>The instructions for ClipSkips use are as follows:</strong></p><br><p><strong>1.</strong> Before starting, ensure that the <strong>ClipSkips</strong> are securely fastened to your feet, providing a comfortable fit to enhance your performance. You may be wondering: <em>\"What if the shoes don't fit my size?\"</em> \u2014 Fortunately, there's no need to worry! The <strong>ClipSkips</strong> are ingeniously designed to intuitively adapt to the shape and size of your feet, ensuring there is no discomfort or possibility of cramping. With this feature, you can confidently move and enjoy your experience without any hassle!</p><br><p><strong>2.</strong> To successfully no-clip, begin by locating the obstruction you wish to phase through. Once you have identified the target, assume a running stance while facing toward the direction of the impediment. When you're ready to initiate the no-clip, approach the physical barrier at a reasonable pace. However, be sure to clear the area of any other obstructions leading up to the barrier, as they could impede your progress and cause you to become partially or completely stuck within the wall.</p><br><p><strong>3.</strong> When approaching the physical barrier, it is important to maintain a steady pace as you collide or phase through it. This allows the inherent absorption and propulsion features of the <strong>ClipSkips</strong> to work in unison, no matter how rough or soft the obstruction is, providing a smooth and seamless experience. The <strong>ClipSkips</strong>' innovative design allows them to cleverly adapt to the physical impact of the collision, ensuring that the force is absorbed and repelled appropriately, without causing any discomfort or harm to your body.</p><br><p><strong>4.</strong> It is <em>very</em> important to maintain caution as you slip through the physical barrier. It is up to <em>you</em> to account for changes to factors on the other side such as ground height, floor texture, physical obstacles, or gravity. Once successfully through, be mindful of your surroundings and adjust your stance to maintain balance and control. Neglecting to do so could lead to life-threatening injuries, including head and body trauma. By exercising simple awareness and quick reflexes, you can avoid countless mishaps on your blood-pumping thrill-ride! <em>New</em> users are advised to begin by practicing no-clipping at a slower pace, in order to gain familiarity first!</p><br><p>Finally, you're all set to start using your brand-new <strong>ClipSkips</strong>!</p><br><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong><br/>\nDo note that the <strong>ClipSkips</strong> are not indestructible and should be handled with care. Avoid causing intentional damage, as they do not have the capability to self-clean or repair. Additionally, <em>please</em> refrain from excessively utilizing them past their limits,<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup> as this may cause them to malfunction and may cause injury. Rest assured, we are constantly working to improve their durability and maximize their functionality for optimal usage.</p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:175%;\"><strong><em>Speedrunning The Backrooms!</em></strong></span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:115%;\"><strong><em>Embrace the Thrill of Escaping, Flash-Style!</em></strong></span></p><br><p>If you're <em>somehow</em> skeptical about the legitimacy of <strong>ClipSkips</strong> or the honesty of us, the <em>SpeedNoclippers</em>, let me share with you the numerous other benefits and uses of these shoes. You might assume that they're just a one-trick pony, but that couldn't be further from the truth. In fact, there are almost no downsides to using them! These shoes offer a plethora of advantages beyond just providing an easy way to no-clip. I guarantee that once you learn more about what they can do, you'll be convinced that <strong>ClipSkips</strong> <em>are</em> the real deal.</p><br><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Speed</strong></span> is our bread and butter at the <em>SpeedNoclippers</em>\u2014it's what we're all about, and it's literally in our name! You may not know this, but your movement speed increases significantly when you run with the <strong>ClipSkips</strong> on; the faster you move, the greater the increase in speed. Once you stop running, your speed returns to normal. Additionally, there's no limit to how fast you can go; you can outrun almost anything! You see, we believe that with <em>this</em> kind of speed, you can push your limits and explore new horizons in a way that was never possible before! Recently, a member of our electrifying crew found themselves in a hilarious yet adrenaline-fueled encounter that perfectly exemplifies the advantages of our speed:</p><br><p>Alright, hold on tight because I've got a truly <em>wild</em> tale that'll leave you breathless! So there I was, roaming the halls of <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-13\">Level 13</a>, minding my own business like any other day. But out of freaking nowhere, a <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-5\">clump</a> comes barreling around the corner at the end of the hall, hell-bent on chasing me down! Talk about a surprise attack! Thankfully, I had my trusty <strong>ClipSkips</strong> strapped on, ready for action. Without missing a beat, I bolted in the opposite direction, nearly eating the floor in the process. Can you <em>imagine</em> the embarrassment? That clump would've been rolling on the floor, laughing its guts out! But hey, I didn't give it the satisfaction. As I sprinted, time seemed to slow down, like some crazy slow-motion scene. The clump was closing in, reaching out for my legs, but then, <em><strong>BAM!</strong></em> I kicked it into high gear like I'd tapped into some superhuman speed. My heart was pounding, veins pulsing with adrenaline, and suddenly, I was moving faster than I ever thought possible. It was like I had become both the Flash and Sonic rolled into one!</p><br><p>But wait, the story doesn't end there! I came to an abrupt halt, sweat pouring down profusely, heart pounding like it was ready to explode. I thought I had shaken off the clump, but nope, it was still hot on my trail, relentless as ever. Somehow, it seemingly knew exactly where I was. So, I had to pull out the big guns. I did the unthinkable\u2014I no-clipped right through the nearest apartment door. Thank the stars no one was inside, or things would've gotten mighty awkward, real fast, lmao. Now, I have no clue where that ravenous clump ended up, but one thing's for certain\u2014it was left scratching its head in confusion. I mean, who can blame it? It witnessed me go from zero to hero in a split second, and then vanish into thin air like a freaking magician!</p><br><p>I owe my life to those magical <strong>ClipSkips</strong>, let me tell you.

Each tick represents a second closer to the end of something. Some finales accompany new beginnings, while others present a permanent conclusion. Such a powerful force remains uncontrollable, so one would be extremely unwise to underestimate it.</p><br><p>Object 95 viewed from the front.</p><br><p><strong>Object 95</strong>, though visually indistinguishable from an 1800s European pocket watch if observed from the front, inconspicuously hides a digital time display \u2014 referred to as <strong>Object 95.1</strong> \u2014 inside the battery compartment in the back. This peculiar feature was initially thought to be used to check the time, but this was disproven when researchers discovered that the display ticked down, not up. Supposedly possessing some inexplicable, psychedelic aura, <strong>Object 95.1</strong> is known to manifest a temporary feeling of intense dread, nihilism, and apocalypticism through visual hallucinations in those who gaze upon it; the duration and strength of the sensations increases as the display approaches 00:00:00:00, but the effects will quickly cease when wanderers avert their eyes.</p><br><p>The front of the pocket watch functions exactly like a clock, creating a faint ticking noise with every second passed. However, it has been observed that in some locations, <strong>Object 95</strong> physically experiences time dilation, ticking faster or slower than an average clock would when velocity or gravity are altered. This phenomenon is most prevalent on <a href=\"/level-456\">Level 456</a>, where the frequency of the ticking is seldom constant, ranging from occurring every half-second to every 2 seconds as a result of the perpetual gravity shifts. Following this observation, researchers envisioned utilizing <strong>Object 95</strong> to enhance their understanding of how gravity functions differently in the Backrooms, but unfortunately, <strong>Object 95.1's</strong> doomsday visions have rendered this proposal impractical due to them being common distractions.</p><br><p><strong>Object 95.1's</strong> countdown to the end of times.</p><br><p><strong>Object 95.1's</strong> countdown is still poorly understood, though it has been speculated that the pocket watch possesses the power to alter the fabric of the universe \u2014 usually in a random manner \u2014 when a countdown finishes. Wanderers in close proximity to <strong>Object 95</strong> when a countdown finishes will allegedly be implanted with false memories; these can range from minor inconsistencies, such as <a href=\"/the-m-e-g\">the M.E.G.</a> logo's appearance, to major discrepancies, such as the entries presented in the Backrooms database. Though the false memory is vastly stronger for those around <strong>Object 95</strong>, it has been reported that many wanderers throughout the Backrooms share the same false memory, though to a vaguer extent. As a result, researchers have hypothesized that the pocket watch is responsible for the presence of multiple examples of these incidents throughout the Backrooms, a phenomenon designated as the Mandela Effect.</p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:120%;\"><strong>Examples of the Mandela Effect Seemingly Caused By Object 95</strong></span></p><br><p>Reports of the existence of a certain \"Church of the Veiled\" started appearing, likely caused by remembering the \"Church of the Broken Truce\" incorrectly.</p><br><p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Apparently, no such \"Church of the Broken Truce\" exists or has ever existed.</p><br><p>Due to <strong>Object 95's</strong> unusual ability to implant false memories in people, multiple accounts that elaborate on how the M.E.G. came into possession of it exist, though most of these statements contradict each other. Some chronicles detail scenarios where <strong>Object 95</strong> was stolen from The Gearmaker<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-293815-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-293815-1')\">1</a></sup>, while others allege that the watch was found in <a href=\"/level-512\">Level 512</a>. The most common, accepted account of <strong>Object 95's</strong> discovery involves a wanderer, Ella Parker, creating a paradox with her supposed future self on <a href=\"/level-87\">Level 87</a>, resulting in The Gearmaker intervening and giving her the object. When the countdown finished, she was transported to <a href=\"/level-906\">Level 906</a> with no memory of ever entering Level 87, encountering <a href=\"/entity-140\">Blanche</a>, who seemed to differ in appearance from how Parker remembered her. The circumstances involving Parker's memory wipe and the lack of documentation mean that there is technically no proof that the scenario even occurred, giving truth to the theory that this \"official\" account is actually another false memory perpetuated by <strong>Object 95</strong>.</p><br><p>The information presented in the following addendum is confidential, as knowledge of the contents poses a massive risk to wanderers' safety. This decision was not made lightly, but after weeks of debate, the M.E.G. administration has affirmed that this information cannot be revealed to the public. Though it is possible for this restriction to be lifted in the future if the situation improves, Administration Security Override Credentials are currently required to view the rest of the document.</p><br><p>Thank you for your cooperation.</p><br><p><strong>To:</strong> Overseer Kat<br/>\n<strong>From:</strong> Irene Grace<br/>\n<strong>Subject:</strong> Object 89 Inconsistency<br/>\n<strong>08.31.2022</strong></p><br><p>Sorry if this email seems unexpected, but I'd like to divert your attention to <a href=\"/object-89\">Object 89</a> on the database, which appears to be\u2026 your corpse.

    "description": "<p><strong>The Everything Machine</strong> is currently largely misunderstood in its nature, and as of now is undergoing heavy research in order to tap into its capabilities in benefiting The M.E.G. <strong>The Everything Machine</strong> is currently hypothesized to be capable of virtually anything within The Backrooms, and can be used to create or destroy any matter. However, any matter which is created or destroyed will be transmuted to a different medium, often inheriting capabilities similar to the medium taken from. The matter itself collapses in an unidentified way, breaking multiple laws of energy and thermodynamics. It is theorized that complete annihilation occurs, though this is unconfirmed.</p><br><p><strong>The Everything Machine</strong> has multiple connections to <a href=\"/backrooms-robotics\">Backrooms Robotics</a>, and seems to have been developed by them. <strong>The Everything Machine</strong> seems to have been built with the purpose of a potential escape to The Backrooms, however, due to it being marked as a prototype, is currently incapable of fulfilling this purpose. Currently, experiments are being run in order to test the limits of <strong>The Everything Machine</strong>. <strong>The Everything Machine</strong> is still misunderstood, so this process is still undergoing in its early phases.</p><br><p><strong>The Everything Machine</strong> itself resembles a circular device, made up of component \"Hexcubes\". Each Hexcube stores data according to what its purpose is programmed to be, which can be virtually anything. Because of this, it is theoretically possible to tear a hole into reality to leave The Backrooms. However, due to the complexity of the programming within <strong>The Everything Machine</strong>, this is currently considered beyond the scope of possibilities. For now, <strong>The Everything Machine</strong> stores data, and occasionally is used to run test involving <strong>The Everything Machine</strong>.</p><br><p><strong>The Everything Machine's</strong> programming is largely misunderstood, and for this reason, it should only be handled by individuals who can understand the basics of the programming within <strong>The Everything Machine</strong>. A sample of the code within <strong>The Everything Machine</strong> is highly dangerous, and can cause viruses to suddenly form within any device. It is impossible to photograph the code, as code from <strong>The Everything Machine</strong> responds to scanning technoware, and adapts to them accordingly. <strong>The Everything Machine</strong> is believed to run on a mix of Paratechnology and Occult influences, alongside The Backrooms influence itself.</p><br><p>Backrooms Robotics appears to have major influence in the creation of <strong>The Everything Machine</strong>, ranging from the discovery of <strong>The Everything Machine</strong>, to the refinement of <strong>The Everything Machine</strong>, all the way to the near finishing of <strong>The Everything Machine</strong>. The CEO of Backrooms Robotics, Yellow, appears to be putting forth full efforts in attempts to locate <strong>The Everything Machine</strong>, ranging from full search teams, to developing searching technology in attempts to locate <strong>The Everything Machine</strong>. Due to the vague intentions of Backrooms Robotics, alongside their misguided morals and there potential connections to the Cartographers, efforts have been put forth in order to mitigate Backrooms Robotics from locating <strong>The Everything Machine</strong>.</p><br><p><strong>The Everything Machine</strong> was discovered during a meeting with Yellow, head of Backrooms Robotics. In a second look attempt, inspections were made and confirmed that <strong>The Everything Machine</strong> is highly dangerous, so a raid attempt was organized under the guise that it came from <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/the-splinter\">The Splinter</a>. Because of this process, <strong>The Everything Machine</strong> is now in the hands of The M.E.G.</p><br><p>Currently, <strong>The Everything Machine</strong> appears to be capable of many unique processes, ranging from killing Entities, to discovery of new Levels, to formation of materials and supplies. For this reason, the programmers of <strong>The Everything Machine</strong> have put forth efforts to pull off different test with <strong>The Everything Machine</strong>. The logs for these test are as follows:</p><br><p><em>Test Begin Log Time: 9:29\u00a0A.M.</em></p><br><p><em>Testing objects: <strong>The Everything Machine</strong>, The Game Master of Level 389</em></p><br><p><em>Researcher Conducting Test: Researcher Aether, Head of The Everything Machine programming</em></p><br><p><em>Test Log Summary:</em> This test was conducted in order to attempt destruction of <a href=\"/entity-99\">\"The Game Master\"</a>. The following test took place on <a href=\"/level-0\">Level 0</a>.</p><br><p><strong>&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;</strong></p><br><p><strong>Researcher Aether:</strong> Initiating the programming, <strong>The Everything Machine</strong> is now active. Stand back, the current result is unknown.</p><br><p><em><strong>The Everything Machine</strong> begins to vibrate, and one of its Hexcubes begin to vibrate violent. After this point, the Hexcube emerges from <strong>The Everything Machine</strong>, and proceeds to vibrate in the air whilst shaking.</em></p><br><p><strong>Researcher Aether:</strong> Okay, everyone stay calm, <strong>The Everything Machine</strong> is about to activate.</p><br><p><em><strong>The Everything Machine's</strong> Hexcube begins to grow a sharp incisor, and proceeds to cut a hole into reality. From there, <a href=\"/level-389\">Level 389</a> is visible.</em></p><br><p><strong>Researcher Aether:</strong> <strong>The Everything Machine</strong> did it! Entity 99 is-</p><br><p><em>The Hexcube proceeds to return to its dormant state within <strong>The Everything Machine</strong>. The entire machine ceases to vibrate. <strong>The Everything Machine</strong> enters its dormant state.</em></p><br><p><strong>Researcher Aether:</strong> <em>Oh god damn-</em></p><br><p><strong>&lt;END LOG&gt;</strong></p><br><p>After this point, Assistant Researcher Micheal proceeds to turn off the audio log recorder. It is presumed that due to the high output given due to the energy required to open a new entryway into Level 389, <strong>The Everything Machine</strong> exhausted its systems, and then proceeded to go into a dormant state in order to recover energy. For a period of 1 week following this event, <strong>The Everything Machine</strong> was only able to receive code, and was incapable of carrying out commands.</p><br><p><em>Test Begin Log Time: 4:26\u00a0A.M.</em></p><br><p><em>Testing objects: <strong>The Everything Machine</strong>, The Game Master of Level 389</em></p><br><p><em>Researcher Conducting Test: Researcher Azey, explorer and field specialist for <strong>The Everything Machine</strong></em></p><br><p><em>Test Log Summary:</em> This was a follow up log performed in attempt to destroy The Game Master. The following test was conducted on Level 389</p><br><p><strong>&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;</strong></p><br><p><em>Researcher proceeds to take a Hexcube from <strong>The Everything Machine</strong> out before entering the Level 389 rift, already coded with the explicit code to destroy The Game Master.</em></p><br><p><strong>Researcher Azey:</strong> Hello?</p><br><p><strong>Entity 99:</strong> Oooooh~ Has a new guest come to play?</p><br><p><strong>Researcher Azey:</strong> Not quite, I'm here to destroy you.</p><br><p><strong>Entity 99:</strong> Is that so~ Ahahahaha! You jest, I must say~</p><br><p><strong>Researcher Azey:</strong> Initiate Procedure Destroy.</p><br><p><strong>Entity 99:</strong> You can put the toy away, it's worthless to you now~</p><br><p><strong>Researcher Azey:</strong> Wait, what?</p><br><p><strong>Entity 99:</strong> You don't wish to play~</p><br><p><strong>Researcher Azey:</strong> No, just get the hell away from me!</p><br><p><strong>Entity 99:</strong> Now, that's no way to t- Hey, where are you going!</p><br><p><strong>&lt;END LOG&gt;</strong></p><br><p>After this point, Researcher Azey drops the audio recorder, and manages to escape through the rift created by <strong>The Everything Machine</strong>. The rift closes after this point, which appears to be The Game Masters doing. The Hexcube from <strong>The Everything Machine</strong> which was deactivated was inserted back into <strong>The Everything Machine</strong>, and appears to have been fully restored by <strong>The Everything Machine</strong>.</p><br><p><em>Test Begin Log Time: 7:34 P.M.</em></p><br><p><em>Testing objects: <strong>The Everything Machine</strong>, Researcher Mills</em></p><br><p><em>Researcher Conducting Test: None</em></p><br><p><em>Test Log Summary:</em> This test was an unauthorized test which was undergone by Researcher Mills, head of cover-up for <strong>The Everything Machine</strong>. The test appears to have been an attempt to access <a href=\"/the-frontrooms\">The Frontrooms</a>. Any information on the whereabouts of Researcher Mills should be reported immediately.</p><br><p><strong>&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;</strong></p><br><p><strong>Researcher Mills:</strong> I have decided. I'm done here. I'm leaving now, and this machine will let me.</p><br><p><em><strong>The Everything Machine</strong> begins to vibrate, and a single Hexcube can be heard vibrating within the insides of <strong>The Everything Machine</strong>, until it can be heard shooting out and shaking violently.</em></p><br><p><strong>Researcher Mills:</strong> Goodbye everyone, it was a good run.</p><br><p><em>The Hexcube from <strong>The Everything Machine</strong> can be heard vibrating within the air very violently, and then can be heard cracking.</em></p><br><p><strong>Researcher Mills:</strong> Goodby-</p><br><p><em>The Hexcube shatters, alongside a large tearing sound. Researcher Mills can be heard screaming violently.</em></p><br><p><strong>&lt;END LOG&gt;</strong></p><br><p>The audio logger for this recording was found unharmed, alongside the nearby area. The only noticeable difference between the environment before and after this event was a few bloodstains, which matched up with Researcher Mills DNA. The Hexcube itself was severely damaged, but was repaired by <strong>The Everything Machine</strong>.</p><br><p><strong>The Everything Machine</strong> | <strong><a href=\"/scattered-dreams\">HUB</a></strong> | <strong><a href=\"/development-of-the-everything-machine\">Development of The Everything Machine</a></strong> \u00bb</p><br><p><a href=\"/industrialization-canon-hub\">Industrialization Canon Hub</a></p><br><p>This was written by me, <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/yellowislol\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6284593); return false;\"><img alt=\"YellowISlol\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=6284593&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334085\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=6284593)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/yellowislol\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6284593); return false;\">YellowISlol</a></span>!</p><br><p>Image found by <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/aether48\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6926379); return false;\"><img alt=\"Aether48\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=6926379&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334085\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=6926379)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/aether48\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(6926379); return false;\">Aether48</a></span></p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/object-96\">Object 96</a> | Object 97 | <a href=\"/object-98\">Object 98</a> \u00bb</p><br>",

    "description": "<p>The <strong>Hermes device</strong>, named after the Greek god Hermes, a fleet footed emissary of the Pantheon. It is a powerful device designed for effective and fast transportation across levels. Currently manufactured only by <a href=\"/the-u-e-c\">U.E.C.</a>, the device uses ethically questionable methods and components in order to function. Knowledge on how the device functions and how to construct it has been withheld in order to maintain safety and security amongst the factions and people.</p><br><p>A Hermes device works like so: A human brain (or animal brain - citation needed), is submerged in a highly potent bath of <a href=\"/object-11\">Memory Juice</a>. The Memory Juice also contains a melted level key. The current theory as to how the Hermes device works is that it induces dreaming within the brain about varying levels of the Backrooms across a range within the user's position. Eg, if the user's current level is 56, the Hermes device dreams about the levels 6-106. In this scenario, the brain used had a range of 100 levels. Different brains vary in ranges, and also in their responses to pain. Mixing <a href=\"/object-48\">Liquid Pain</a> within the liquid bath can be used to regulate the range by either widening it or shrinking it depending on the brain's reaction to pain. Once an electrical current is applied to the bath, presumably with prongs, transportation occurs. Every time transportation occurs, the brain within the Hermes device degrades slightly. Eventually, the brain will degrade to a point where it is no longer possible to use the Hermes device without replacing the brain.</p><br><p>A single Hermes device has the capability to transport up to 150 kilograms before failing to function, or worse, transporting only a portion.</p><br><p>The Hermes device has a wide array of applications including: Effective escape measures in the form of 'jumps', eg. Using a brain with a small transportation range in order to only transport yourself one or two levels away as to escape a sticky situation.</p><br><p>The Hermes device can also be used for long range level traversal, crossing dozens of levels in only a few days. The Hermes device is a powerful tool for any person in the Backrooms, although the ethical issues of harvesting human brains remains a large factor in preventing the blueprints and early prototypes of the Hermes device captured by M.E.G. operatives from being released to the public.</p><br><p>Anyone in possession of a Hermes device is near impossible to track down due to these advanced capabilities, and attempts by the M.E.G. to capture those who do have Hermes devices have so far failed.</p><br><p>Notable groups currently in possession of Hermes devices are as follows:</p><br><p><a href=\"/the-u-e-c\">The U.E.C.</a> - The creators of the Hermes device; a dangerous small splinter faction of rogue M.E.G. scientists developing tech utilising the strange quirks of the Backrooms. Currently wanted by M.E.G.</p><br><p><a href=\"/the-m-e-g\">The M.E.G.</a> - The M.E.G. has collected several unfinished blueprints and an early prototype of a Hermes device during a raid on The U.E.C., prior to their escape with completed Hermes devices and other illegal research as well as multiple rare resources.</p><br><p>\u00ab <a href=\"/object-98\">Object 98</a> | Object 99 | <a href=\"/object-100\">Access Denied</a> \u00bb</p><br>",

    "description": "<p>Daedos, known in some early scientific literature as \"The Backrooms\" for the name given to it by several semi-sapient parasitic cultures that reside in its Crust, is the single largest living organism in the known higher multiverse, though it is outclassed in size by several deceased organisms, such as The Great Ring, Antivoid, P, and GOD. The organism has been determined by memetic markers to be a gargantuan meta-clonal colony that takes up uncountably infinite 3rd-dimensional space and approximately 12<sup>3024</sup> azulaks of 5th-dimensional space, possibly extending farther into imperceptible higher dimensions. Its continued expansion is owed to its self-replication process wherein it absorbs memetic information that is brought into it and incorporates that memetic information into replications of its memome, allowing it to grow by creating knots containing infinite physical representations of absorbed concepts.</p><br><p>The 3rd-dimensional Crust that makes up Daedos's outer shell is located entirely within a spatial-well known as The Stack. The Stack's spatially anomalous nature has allowed spatially infinite <a href=\"/normal-levels-i\">knots</a> that contain repetitions of similar structures to coexist within the same dimensional area without being separated by 4th-dimensional space. Additionally, in between these knots are a series of <a href=\"/blue-channel\">voids</a> that allow the knots to expand in 3rd-dimensional space without entering the spatial area of another knot, with few <a href=\"/the-foundry\">exceptions</a>. This abnormal spatial arrangement is believed to be what has allowed Daedos to attain the unusually long survival it has attained for an organism of its size.</p><br><p>Extending out of The Stack and into 4th- and 5th-dimensional space is the poorly understood main section of Daedos, known as The Goop. The Goop is a 10<sup>3024</sup> azulak large 5th-dimensional structure composed almost entirely of abstract memetic material with scattered vacuoles of concrete space, the most massive of which being the central Core. Due to its extension into the 4th and 5th dimensions, The Goop and The Core are incredibly poorly understood but are believed to play an integral role in the structural and metastructural integrity of the organism as a whole and the self-replicating nature of the organism's crust.</p><br><p>For most of Daedos' known history, it took the form of a primarily undefined mass containing snippets of incompatible and contradictory concepts that were believed to have been absorbed from nearby universes, as well as from virtual meme-antimeme pairs created in conceptual fluctuations. This changed, however when The Stack collided mildly with the universe <a href=\"/the-frontrooms\">U-749690</a>, and exchange of matter and concepts began occurring between Daedos and U-749690, as well as U-749690's surrounding <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation\">quantum alternates</a>. This caused Daedos' Crust to take on the conceptual ideas found within the minds of U-749690's semi-sapient life forms, as well as the proliferation of those lifeforms within Daedos' Crust that we see today.</p><br><p>Within the Crust of Daedos are a number of microbiomes containing many different types of <a href=\"/entities\">specialized cells and micro-organisms</a> that act symbiotically to maintain complex and poorly understood systems of homeostasis within the organism. In addition to these symbiotic micro-organisms, the crust is home to an invasive species of semi-sapient parasitic organism from U-749690, called <a href=\"/entity-1\">Etinil</a>, which are particularly of note due to the lasting ecological impact they have caused to Daedos. It is unknown for certain what the existence of the Etinil means for the continued survival of Daedos, but some scientists have theorized that they will inevitably bring the death of Deados due to the damage they have accrued to its homeostatic systems. It is believed that at the current time, Daedos has been rendered incapable of developing new knots in its crust at the rate that they die, and further diversions from the state of homeostasis will lead to unpredictable effects to the organism as a whole.</p><br><p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Nick Kevorkian<br/>\n<strong>Interviewed:</strong> The Historian</p><br><p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p><br><p><strong>Nick Kevorkian:</strong> I'll keep it short because I don't want to waste any of my time ration. Will my plan work?</p><br><p><strong>The Historian:</strong> It will work, but it will have consequences beyond what you are prepared for.</p><br><p><strong>Nick Kevorkian:</strong> Oh, and what consequences are those?</p><br><p><strong>The Historian:</strong> We cannot tell you the answer to that either without you agreeing to never leave the level.</p><br><p><strong>Nick Kevorkian:</strong> Why?</p><br><p><strong>The Historian:</strong> As harmful as the lies you plan on spreading will be, it will be much less damaging for you to feel the consequences of your actions than for you to learn to rely on us to tell you when it is safe to warp reality with your lies.</p><br><p><strong>Nick Kevorkian:</strong> Why do you hate lying so much?</p><br><p><strong>The Historian:</strong> We do not hate. We simply know that some things will not be constructive to humanity as a whole, and lying is one of them. Lies are alive, in a way. Not literally by scientific definitions, but they operate on a level similar to that of a virus, invading your brain and controlling you into spreading it to others to increase its rate of infection in much the same way that a simple virus hijacks a cell to produce more copies of itself. You may think you are accomplishing something great, but the infection will spread beyond your control.</p><br><p><strong>Nick Kevorkian:</strong> You know everything, so you know I'm doing this for the greater good.</p><br><p><strong>The Historian:</strong> There are no good intentions. There are simply good results. Like all humans, your goals are fundamentally selfish. You desire what you see as best for humanity, but only because your brain has been programmed to give you positive emotions when you help others. You do not desire the greater good. You desire the emotions you will feel if you're the one who creates that greater good, and while those emotions may produce a positive outcome in many situations, it's currently making you short-sighted. You refuse to let go of an opportunity to be humanity's savior, and it will be your downfall.</p><br><p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p><br><p>ENTITY is a decentralized group of radical political activists and artists across various levels of the Backrooms that advocate for the rights and equality of entities. The movement spread by word of mouth after the anonymous publishing of a short document known as \"The ENTITY Manifesto\". Because of the lack of any official leadership structure, the specific actions of the group vary from person to person, ranging from producing political art pieces that bring attention to their beliefs to the infiltration and violent takeover of groups deemed to be harmful to entities.</p><br><p>We are ENTITY.</p><br><p>All of us are ENTITY.</p><br><p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p><br><p><strong>Ace Troth:</strong> So, what exactly am I looking at?</p><br><p><strong>Nick Kevorkian:</strong> My new theory about Almond Water and the backrooms as a whole.</p><br><p><strong>Ace Troth:</strong> Explain.</p><br><p><strong>Nick Kevorkian:</strong> Well, from what I've gathered, the Backrooms changes over time, and those changes are reflections of people's thoughts. Which means that, in theory, if we can convince enough people to believe something is true, we should be able to manifest it.</p><br><p><strong>Ace Troth:</strong> And how do you know that, exactly?</p><br><p><strong>Nick Kevorkian:</strong> Well, I don't for sure, but I plan on testing it, and by the nature of it, any test needs to be on a pretty big scale. So, my plan is that since we have concrete evidence of Almond Water changing over time, we convince as many people as possible that Almond Water has morphed into something more powerful, let's call it \"Super Almond Water\", and see if the properties of Almond Water change to match.</p><br><p><strong>Ace Troth:</strong> Kind of a stupid name.</p><br><p><strong>Nick Kevorkian:</strong> We'll workshop it later. The point is that this is kind of risky, but if it works, it'll be huge for us.</p><br><p><strong>Ace Troth:</strong> Do you know how hard it'll be to get the Overseers to let us spread misinformation? That's against everything the M.E.G. stands for.</p><br><p><strong>Nick Kevorkian:</strong> The M.E.G. stands for more than just the truth, and if they can't see that, then don't bother to get their permission. This has the potential to change everything.</p><br><p><strong>Ace Troth:</strong> Hm. I'll see what I can do.</p><br><p><strong>&lt;End Scene&gt;</strong></p><br><p><em>The white lily stares carefully at the closing door, catching one last glimpse of the man exiting before the curtain drops.</em></p><br><p><em><a href=\"/lines-please\">The man attached to the flower</a> looks down, reviewing his lines and mumbling to himself. \"Ace Troth.

Quinoa appears to have a uniquely scattered worldview. His knowledge of any given topic is limited and often incorrect. Episodes of \"Talking With Quinoa\" are usually nonsensical and disjointed, with very few reoccurring topics between broadcasts. Past talking points have included a ranking of rock-based materials based on how \"crunchy\" they are, dating advice, seances, and a discussion of the merits of cannibalism.</p><br><p><strong>Quinoa:</strong> I actually got a phone call from YHWH the other day.

I'm actually here promoting my new non-fiction book, \"More Human Than I\". Some have credited it as contributing greatly to the deconstruction of the binary social relation between human and entity in our society, but I try to be humbler about it. I think that it's simply common sense that the pedestal we put humans on as somehow special is completely arbitrary when you consider that we're more of an invasive species than any so-called entity in the Backrooms, and I'm just glad people are waking up to that method of thinking. I mean, even the labels of \"human\" and \"entity\" exist solely on account of and for each other, and by resolving the dialectic between those two labels, we can see that humans are just as \"entity\" as any other life in the Backrooms.</p><br><p><strong>Quinoa:</strong> You know, I've always considered myself to be the modern-day Barrack Obama.

Remember to follow your heart, everybody!</p><br><p>A recent and unexplained shift has changed Almond Water from a nutritious drink that maintains physical health to a powerful panacea capable of potentially healing any wound or illness, physical or otherwise, and exterminating any hostile entities it comes into contact with. This new form has been dubbed \"Super Almond Water\". Analysis by M.E.G. personnel suggests that the effect is currently muted but will go into full effect over the next few weeks. Wanderers who are suffering from anything of any kind are encouraged to begin taking Almond Water daily over the next couple weeks and report its effects to your local M.E.G. Base. This discovery could change everything for us, so it is incredibly important that you spread the news of Super Almond Water to as many people as you can. We are witnessing how powerful a glimmer of hope can be.</p><br><p><strong>Unknown:</strong> \"Level 18: safe, secure, minimal entity count.\" Did you know that until very recently, it was impossible to label a level as \"safe\" unless it had \"minimal entities\"? Does that make sense to you?</p><br><p><em>[Members of the crowd yell out \"No!\"]</em></p><br><p><strong>Unknown:</strong> The idea of plastering the number of entities on a safety rating makes me sick. The human-supremacist view is baked into the very structure of the Database and everyone who contributes to it. The M.E.G., our supposed heroes label themselves the \"saviors of humanity\". But what about those who don't fall under their rigid definitions of a normal \"human\"? I think we all know how much saving would happen, then.</p><br><p><strong>Unknown:</strong> I brought you here to this level today to show you something. In front of you is a piece of ground labeled with the grave of a peaceful being who once lived in M.E.G. Base Alpha. His name was \"Mo\", and he was a wonderful soul who brought joy to all those he interacted with. A few weeks ago, he passed away under what the M.E.G. labeled as natural causes. His funeral was held on this level believed to be his place of origin. I have dug up the shallow grave where his coffin rested for a reason you will soon understand.</p><br><p><em>[The unknown speaker can be heard moving around something heavy and wooden.]</em></p><br><p><strong>Unknown:</strong> Empty. Do you know why this coffin is empty? We found Mo's body in a storage room at Base Alpha. It was never buried in the coffin.</p><br><p><em>[The unknown speaker can be heard tearing back a sheet. The crowd gasps in shock.]</em></p><br><p><strong>Unknown:</strong> Does <em>this</em> look like natural causes to you? Does this look like an <em>accident</em>? Leaked M.E.G. correspondence revealed that this being was <em>used</em> as a tool to access another level. Today the M.E.G. released an announcement claiming they've discovered a way to use Almond Water to \"exterminate hostile entities\". So, let me ask you, which is a more hostile entity, the poor being whose body I now hold in my hands or the monsters who slaughtered him?</p><br><p><em>[The crowd begins yelling.]</em></p><br><p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p><br><p>Deep inside the Goop, concepts and anti-concepts form and deform, and for a brief moment, a piece of chaos coalesces into the form of a lamb and a skeleton.</p><br><p>\"Petya,\" the lamb begins, \"Have you heard the Zen Buddhist koan about the cow?\"</p><br><p>The skeleton does not reply. It's already dead. It's been dead a long time.</p><br><p>\"I was raised Gnostic, so forgive me if this isn't perfectly accurate, but I'm told the koan is a phrase that first seems to be absurd, but by focusing your meditation on the phrase, not on understanding it but becoming it, you can find some insight there.\"</p><br><p>\"The phrase is thus: 'On big island live only one cow'. Seems queer, no? I mean, it's not even grammatically correct. But grammar is not meaning. If I presented you with a map that has each country mixed up and shuffled, you would not throw the map away for lack of accuracy. You would wonder what world I had seen to possess me into presenting that map as the truth.\"</p><br><p>\"It is specifically by freeing itself from the control of the system of grammar that the koan of the cow finds its beauty, for the confusion caused by such syntactical play frees up the unconscious mind while the conscious is busy decoding the symbols in front of it.\"</p><br><p>\"So let's play at decoding. It is not 'a big island'; it is not 'the big island'; the article is left off because it is something deeper than that: the fundamentally archetypal concept of 'big island' that has been passed through the collective unconscious of humanity in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeolia_(mythical_island)\">myths</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laputa\">stories</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_Nine_(sphere)\">dreams</a>. The choice of 'live' instead of 'lives', too, is important because it is one cow, but it is: one. The cow is not just cow, but all that ever is or was.\"</p><br><p>\"And one day the you will understand that. You are the cow. You are the island. You are alive. And you are one.\"</p><br><p>Somewhere, far away, a <a href=\"/level-756\">cow</a> takes in its first breath of air, though chronologically, it has been breathing for a very long time, and in between two eternities of silence, the skeleton speaks for the first and last time: \"To-o-o-o bbbbbbe honest, \ud83d\udc41 n ever quighght liked the taste ov bananana laff<sub>y</sub> taff<sub>y</sub>.\"</p><br><p>\"Aye,\" the lamb replies, \"I can sympathize with that point of view.\"</p><br><p>The lamb continues: \"In 1946, Jorge Luis Borges wrote of an apocryphal map of the territory of a lost empire. This map, he said, was built with such exactitude that it reached a 1:1 scale, but as the empire fell, the map was no longer maintained, and the decaying corpse of the facsimile was all but abandoned, derelict except for the occasional beast or beggar that found shelter in its rotting paper walls.\"</p><br><p>\"I think this is the fate of all simulacra: all meaning slowly being squeezed out by the incestuous process of copying copies of copies until what little worth once was is spread far too thin to mean anything. It's strange to consider the lineage of Disneyland. It's a representation of reproductions of reproductions of fables and fairy tales that were once meant to represent real life many generations ago. But that life it represented has come and gone, the meaning dissolved into a hollow nostalgia trap, designed perfectly in a lab so that every coming generation feels the same nostalgia for the empty culture that was shoved down their throat by their parents who, in turn, ate the same corporate slop.\"</p><br><p>\"I will never be able to taste the pure Gros Michel banana that isoamyl acetate shallowly tries to recreate because we killed it long ago. In our greed for unified chemical perfection, we slowly bred out the diversity of the fruits mother nature had made for us until they were all wiped out by a single disease. There truly is something sick about the way these empty simulacra are the closest we have to an original we can never get back. So I hold no judgment to those who cannot stomach the taste.\"</p><br><p><em>Dear M.E.G.

Interest in Object 101 peaked when the <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-eternal-repository\">Eternal Repository</a> observed it emitting a faint light during a mining operation in an undisclosed resource mine. The initial study on the object was led by Junior Scientist Ibrahim Frvyo, who is the namesake of Object 101.</p><br><p>Frvyo jades are primarily used for detecting entities (excluding <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-1\">humans</a>) within a finite area<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> and determining their danger levels. This suggests that Frvyo jades can adapt to spontaneous scenarios, although, this adaptation can vary depending on specific situations, such as being in a group or in a secure environment. Frvyo jades are, in their base state, moss-colored jades most often located within cave systems with an average temperature of 8\u00b0C\u201314\u00b0C (46.4\u00b0F\u201357.2\u00b0F). Object 101 is generally dense and tough, which scales 6.1\u20136.6 on the Mohs scale of mineral hardness, and can be mined with ease using sturdy metal pickaxes, hammers, chisels, shovels, and other mining tools.</p><br><p>Object 101 contains a substance that is confirmed to produce its anomalous effect (i.e., \"Frvyo reflection\"). This substance, Frvyo, is yet to be extensively analyzed due to the lack of appropriate equipment necessary for such evaluation. Additionally, it is still unclear if the substance is an element or a compound.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup></p><br><p>Frvyo is notoriously hard to isolate from the nephrite jade and highly reactive to almost anything but the gem it is contained within. Once in contact with any substance other than the nephrite jade, it would immediately form a compound with that substance. Named \"Frvyo gas,\" this compound is highly toxic, even in small doses.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')\">3</a></sup></p><br><p>Thus, in summary, we will regard Frvyo as <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">an anomalous compound that can only act as an element within its composite foundation: nephrite jade</span>.</p><br><p>Frvyo jades are also used as customary accessories or jewelry.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-4\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')\">4</a></sup> Accessories made from Object 101 materials are most commonly known in terms such as Frvyo rings, necklaces, brooches, earrings, pendants, bracelets, etc.</p><br><p>The presence and danger level of an entity are detected through the phenomenon of Frvyo reflection, wherein the Frvyo within the jade disperses invisible particles that act as a sonar and react with the appropriate illumination intensity when it detects an entity within its radius. This strangely excludes humans but not entities that possess human biology or composition (e.g., <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-9\">facelings</a>, <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-10\">skin-stealers</a>).<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-5\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')\">5</a></sup></p><br><p>Frvyo jades exhibit their effects when an entity is within the reflection area of Frvyo. Once an entity is nearby, the jade will illuminate using Frvyo as its energy source. This illumination will shine varying hues of green that are determined by the entity's danger or threat level. Known illumination intensities are listed below in descending order</p><br><p>It is believed that Frvyo can only detect and react to the native entities or forces that originate from the Backrooms, as it is a compound that currently only exists here; this could be the reason why Frvyo is unable to detect humans or creatures of Frontrooms origin. Although there are entities that take on the guise of humans, they do not originate from Earth, or the Frontrooms, directly.</p><br><p>Though this point could be likened to humans born within the Backrooms, it has been confirmed and tested<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-6\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')\">6</a></sup> that these humans do not display any danger level in the illumination chart. The same fact goes towards creatures that no-clipped from the Frontrooms. It is apparent that undetectability could be gentically inherited by offspring, as long as they descend from people who originate from outside of the Backrooms. Though this may suggest the possibility for entities who possess human biology or composition to go undetected by the effects of Frvyo, any Backrooms origin overrules such.</p><br><p>Indeed, possessing human body parts may minimally skew the exact danger level of the entity, but Frvyo will always identify and recognize the innate nativeness of the entity possessing human composition, and as a result, they are able to be detected through Frvyo reflection.</p><br><p>These theories sparked a massive debate regarding entities that exhibit human identity, behavior, and characteristics. Considerations regarding the existence of entities who identify as humans were questioned due to the influence of Frvyo jades. But most researchers defended Frvyo jades, saying that they are simply devices for detecting foreign from non-foreign and not about distinguishing humans from entities.</p><br><p>Although there is no definite explanation as to why humans or creatures of Frontrooms origin are the only exception to Frvyo reflection, it is widely accepted that it is better to simply look forward and use Frvyo jades for their benefits rather than for their connotations.</p><br><p>Groups of interest, such as <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/backrooms-robotics\">Backrooms Robotics</a> and <a href=\"http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/b-n-t-g\">The B.N.T.G.</a>, have been collaborating with the Eternal Repository in the manufacturing and distribution of Frvyo jade accessories and equipment. It is due to these efforts spearheaded by the cooperation of these groups that it quickly became ordinary for common people to wear Object 101, whose application has been utilized in several explorations that further expansion within the Backrooms.</p><br><p>In isolated environments, like forests or caves, where the entity population is on the lower end, Frvyo jades are one's lifesaver. But in high-entity population environments, such as metropolitan settings and uncontained levels, these objects are confusing and would be in constant change in the presence of multiple entities. Thus, it is preferable that explorers do not rely too much on the object, as it is also unstable and dynamic depending on specific circumstances.</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/object-101\">Object 101 - \"Frvyo Jades\"</a>\" by Schulzenreich, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.

    "title": "Object 216 - \"Hyrum Lanterns\"",
    "description": "<p>An image of a Hyrum Lantern taken from <a href=\"/level-9\">Level 9</a>.</p><br><p>The instance to the left is a handheld Hyrum Lantern with a design particularly similar to lanterns of the 70s era: the base and handle of the lantern are made of slightly rusted metal, with thin pieces hugging the glass that encompasses the flame. This instance was located inside a living room by the <a href=\"/the-m-e-g\">M.E.G.'s</a> Penelope Harveston, during a certain expedition that took place within Level 9. Hyrum Lanterns are predominantly found in dark levels and are of utmost importance for survival in the Backrooms due to a specific process known as the Inverse Moth Effect which will be discussed further on. Hyrum Lanterns are exceptionally shatter-resistant, lightweight, and durable, capable of withstanding a force of at least 2 tons.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup> Additionally, these lanterns tend to emit faint yet warm and calming fragrances, such as lavender, vanilla, and chamomile; it is assumed that this is only an aftereffect from Hyrum Light once the lantern is ignited, as this does not permeate once it is turned off. It is also observed that when turned on, Hyrum Lanterns produce a quiet humming similar to white noise. These features thus help those traveling to remain collected and clear of mind despite stressful situations.</p><br><p>Though Hyrum Lanterns often glow a white-golden light that shines around at 480-515 Lumens<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')\">3</a></sup> on average, there are cases where a certain number of lanterns can reach up to 1000 Lumens in brightness and have a more potent or direct Inverse Moth Effect compared to other Hyrum Lanterns. However, this does not necessarily mean that the two have drastic differences in values, as they still retain the same maximum and minimum IME<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-4\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')\">4</a></sup> rates. It is not found how long a Hyrum Lantern can stay in activation, though it is assumed that one could operate the lantern as many times as one pleases. In some cases that are yet to be further looked into, the object may also activate randomly for the individual using it. Observations also show that Hyrum Lanterns do not experience total energy loss or any increase in temperature even when in activation.</p><br><p>The Inverse Moth Effect (I.M.E. for short) is the effect in which Hyrum Lanterns repels any entities within a 15-foot radius (or a circumference of 94.25 feet) as far as a distance of 30 feet from the holder of the lantern and will retreat further if approached. Despite the fact that Hyrum Lanterns do not exude temperatures high enough to cause harm, aggressive or naturally dangerous entities that are caught within the light's vicinity will endure severe or occasionally lethal burns; entities resistant to burns do not make an exception from this effect.</p><br><p>As of the current time, the only organisms that have complete immunity against Hyrum Light are humans and the species of the petrified\u2014the latter not only having deep devotion to an enigmatic figure simply known as the First Prince but also being created directly from the First Brilliance, albeit from a different fragment that we have yet to know. Harmless/passive entities will usually be safe from the lantern\u2019s light, though there have been cases where the opposite occurred. Humans that have been mutated into entities, as well as entities that have gained human intelligence, are not immune from the Inverse Moth Effect. It is presumed from this information that Hyrum Light follows a strict set of natural laws that cannot be exactly pinpointed due to its vague specificity.</p><br><p>Based on previous observations, the activation period of a lantern (though never flickering and ever-constant) appears to be constant for as long as the individual possessing it keeps faith within the object. Further study shows that those who also believe in the existence of the First Brilliance can keep their Hyrum Lantern activated for long periods; in some cases, the lantern turns on automatically in the presence of danger. Once a Hyrum Lantern is deactivated, entities that were driven away from the area will remain disoriented and fearful of the light for approximately 2 to 4 minutes, then regain partial cognitive abilities. Entities that have regenerative traits will heal from the scorches much slower than their usual processes, but will eventually be active.</p><br><p>Since Hyrum Light embodies and manifests in all lanterns in the Backrooms, manmade ones or lanterns that were not naturally generated by a level/did not already exist inside a level, are no exception to this rule. The Artificial Inverse Moth Effect (A-I.M.E. for short) eventuates when creating a new lantern; Hyrum Light will indeed manifest within the lantern, but not at its full potential. In fact, 99.8% of Hyrum Light's potential effects are completely annulled by this precedent artificiality. It is not exactly known why this is the case nor why it is near-impossible to create an effective A-I.M.E.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-5\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')\">5</a></sup> despite its certain possibility; however, the main hypothesis most researchers and scholars in the enigmatic study strongly support connects back to the enigma, the First Prince and the apparent sentience of Hyrum Light itself.</p><br><p>Though still mostly unidentified (and others already stated) even with the help of some of the first-generation elders of the petrified, Hyrum Light is speculated to be unnaturally semi-sentient\u2014that is, it follows its own set of rules that cannot be altered or meddled with except by the First Prince\u2014its only maker through the First Brilliance. Hyrum Light does not form its rules on existing laws of universes, especially in the Backrooms, it creates them by itself almost independently. It evolves and scatters in all forms of light, and it may be that Hyrum Light was made to evolve on what is necessary to scatter the First Brilliance in all the parts of realms both known and unknown. Out of all possibilities, it chose a lantern as its incarnation in the Backrooms and therefore, still spreads its influence (even if ineffectively) to all instances of lanterns within it. Why a lantern was chosen of all objects is still unknown, but this proves the credence of the specified vagueness of Hyrum Light.</p><br><p>Compiled below is a catalog of recorded files, data, and information compiled by the Major Exploration Group's Veracity Searchers, who were given approval for the object's study and analysis by the Overseer Council on June 19th, 2021 as a result of a formal request from Tristan Petrovic.</p><br><p>As of current, it is believed that the activation period of Object 216 \"Hyrum Lanterns\" (including I.M.E.) is set at complete random. This test aims to find the true reason for its activation and its logic, as well as to attempt to set the activation period to a more solid, reliable timeframe to ensure wanderers' safety through provided means\u2014e.g., faith, belief, and reason.</p><br><p>To aid with the following experiments, historians have unraveled scriptures and documents from the Lost Era<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-6\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')\">6</a></sup> which contain the first tales of Hyrum Light\u2014Hyrum Lanterns by direct extension\u2014where mentions of strong faith were what linked one to the lantern. Using these scripts, several random participants were exposed to instances of Hyrum Lanterns in two different situations.</p><br><p>4 participants were seated separately within relatively dim rooms with two researchers and each given a Hyrum Lantern. A fifth room was prepared with no participant inside. Each participant is told to interact with the object however they pleased.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nThe first subject is Natalee Thompson, a 31-year-old woman who volunteers frequently at the M.E.G., who initially signed up for possible testing of the Hyrum Lantern. She first enters the room with brief excitement and is told to sit at the table. When the object is placed in front of them, Thompson appears to take a mild interest in the lantern. It is taken into consideration that the subject has not seen the object beforehand. After examining the lantern for about 2 minutes, the subject then activates the lantern, which glows a rather faint hue. Attempting to make it glow brighter, she turns the knob multiple times. The lantern's luminosity weakens considerably as Thompson expresses her disappointment. Eventually, the subject loses complete interest and the lantern completely deactivates. After a few more minutes of attempting to reactivate the lantern to no avail, observers assess Thompson and remove her from the experiment.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nThe second and third subjects, twins Michael and George Ramsay, are both 5-year-old boys who were taken in for the experiment by their mother, Minerva Ramsay. Both were separated into different rooms and, like Thompson, given the lanterns.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nThe first twin, Michael Ramsay, expresses slight fear at the dimness of the room. When offered the lantern, the subject declines, pushes it away from him, and begins to softly cry. In a few minutes, the lantern automatically turns on, revealing a bright flame. The child calms down and warms up to it rather quickly, and so takes the object in his hands. The brightness of the lantern increases and the observers recall a stronger scent of lavender filling the room. Within five minutes, the subject lays his head on the table and falls asleep. Michael was then lifted up and taken out of the experiment room to his mother, where George was taken in for the same experiment. After awakening, the researchers assess Michael\u2019s state and remove him from the experiment.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nUnlike Michael, who as noted by observers was quiet and reserved, George expresses qualities of high energy. The subject interacts with the researchers cheerfully, asking several questions about the purpose of the experiment. When given the lantern, it is eagerly taken and played around with. The subject then proceeds to turn the knob to activate the lantern, which merely emits a soft glow. In an attempt to make the Hyrum Lantern glow brighter, the second twin shakes it in futility. The lantern\u2019s light wanes significantly. After several attempts at forcing the lantern to return to its original luminosity, George throws the lantern at the wall and leaves the room. After thorough inspection, the object appears to have taken no damage, but no longer activates upon turning the knob. After several hours, an assessment is conducted and the subject is removed from the experiment.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nThe final participant, accompanied by an instance of <a href=\"/entity-198\">Entity 198</a><sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-7\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')\">7</a></sup>, is a 21-year-old by the name of Theo Bryant, a wanderer that had just entered the Backrooms 2 months prior to the experiment and was living inside of <a href=\"/level-18\">Level 18</a> for 1 month. The researchers provide Bryant with the same instructions and another instance of Object 216. Upon first glance, they show signs of slight distrust and only prod at the object. Within a few minutes, the subject reluctantly picks up the lantern and activates it. Observers recall seeing a very faint glow coming from the object. Similar to the second subject, Bryant expresses a liking for the lantern. After 3 minutes of interacting with the object, the subject turns to present it to their companion behind them\u2014it isn\u2019t until then that Bryant discovers the burnt remains of the Plush Dino, which burned up in the presence of the Hyrum Lantern\u2019s light. Bryant then drops the lantern in horror and sits back down. Immediately after the incident, the researchers took the subject out of the experiment and ended up requiring about 2 weeks of therapy. As for the lantern, though it immediately deactivated upon the subject dropping it, continued to work in perfect condition.</p><br><p>Prior to the experiment, two random groups of 16 were taken in for testing; one will be exposed to various related to the Hyrum Lantern, including knowledge of the Petrified Subjects themselves (named Group 1), while the other will simply receive the object without prior knowledge to its properties (named Group 2). In each scenario, both groups will be released to the same level, at the same time, and under the same conditions.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nThe experiment begins with Group 2, who were told to traverse 50 meters within a particular area of Level 9 with the lanterns activated. The group was motivated by observers to talk about Hyrum Lanterns and was instructed to theorize what type of abnormality would the lanterns possess. After more than 1 minute of brainstorming, all passed and assumed it was most likely the light that would exhibit the properties of the object. The lanterns, in the hands of their holders, glowed brighter; observers took note.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nWhen presented with a threat, Group 2's initial reaction was to flee. Observers located far away from the location would insist that they stay and try to use the lantern against the approaching entity a <a href=\"/entity-3\">Smiler</a>. Once one of the lanterns was hesitantly raised in front of the entity, though gleaming dimly, it burned the entity upon contact with the gold light and slightly revealed the entity's form from the brightness before the entity retreated frenziedly, screeching and scorching. It was seen after the encounter that the lanterns were shining brighter than they were previously, and the trust the group had poured into the objects had made them more potent.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nA day later, at the same time, Group 1 was given the same lanterns. During a brief five-minute waiting period where the subjects were encouraged to speak to one another, it was observed from their interaction that three subgroups were formed amongst the subjects: eight who were almost fully convinced that the lanterns were indeed created by an ancient being and believed the lantern would protect them, four who were neutral and chose to follow whatever would happen during the experiment but still believed to be protected by the lantern, two who did not believe in the idea at all, and another two who did not seem to care. After the waiting period, Group 1 was sent out to traverse Level 9.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nDuring this time, observers noticed the difference in the luminosity of each lantern of the subgroups, their beliefs about the object impacted the lanterns' properties, and while it would not necessarily have affected its I.M.E. rates, it would certainly seem so, after more time was spent wandering, that it will affect a Hyrum Lantern's duration in staying lit. The experimentees, after observers discovered the fact thereafter, were separated accordingly. The first subgroup showed to have their lanterns activated the longest, having lasted 5 hours before deactivating; the second subgroup's remained alight for 1 hour; the fourth's lasted 50 minutes; the third's lasted 30 seconds.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nIt is from these tests and the various sources collected from the Petrified that it is discovered that Hyrum Lanterns rely on faith, belief, reason, and even logic to activate. More experiments were done after these two and they had relatively the same results as this study.</p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p><br><p>On the 22nd of June, 2021, at 8:03 PM, the first recorded I.M.E. event took place in Level 9 after the current Veracity Searcher member Penelope Harveston discovered an Object 216 instance on the porch of a house on the level, who therein, activated the lantern under the threat of a Smiler. From her pure will to live, the lantern was set ablaze and a golden light scorched the entity. This marked the onset of the following live subject testings in regard to the object's properties, which have been given the proper approval by the Overseer Council.</p><br><p>[Transcript Starts]<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n[00:03] <em>Elizabeth Loomis\u2014Ely from now on\u2014is placed within the chamber and tasked to grab the lantern on top of the table in front of him.</em><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n[00:10] <em>The subject takes the lantern and illuminates the room in gold light. Observers task Ely to hold the lantern in front of the window. They acquiesce.</em><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n[00:17] <em>Smiler specimen manifests and the lantern wanes significantly in light as Ely can be observed to be trembling, though almost unnoticeable. Observers take note of this and proceed to tell Ely to stay still. The Smiler takes notice of the light and rushes toward the holder at great speed.</em><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n[00:22] <em>Ely braces for the entity's impact as the lantern almost returns to its previous luminosity, the Smiler crashes on the stone wall outside of the iron bars before it screeches instantaneously while burning can be heard alongside the ear-piercing noise. The impact causes the subject to yelp and clutch onto the lantern tighter, and as such, the brightness of the lantern increases tenfold. This continues for 16 seconds before the entity falls silent.</em><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n[00:24] <em>Observers and personnel ensure that the specimen has been executed by the lantern. Once confirmed, Ely is escorted out of the chamber and taken in for assessment. The subject appears calm and collected, and presented a cheery and hopeful demeanor as they kept the distinguished lantern in hand. After being left alone for an extra 10-15 minutes, they are taken back with their group and the lantern is removed from their person.</em></p><br><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-size:110%;\"><strong>All information was sourced from:</strong></span></p><br><p><em>\"Bettering Humanity\"</em></p><br><p><em>\"Petrificatus In Lumine Suo\"</em></p><br><p><span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/schulzenreich\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7844614); return false;\"><img alt=\"Schulzenreich\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7844614&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334085\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7844614)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/schulzenreich\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7844614); return false;\">Schulzenreich</a></span> &amp; <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/trailmixncocoa\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7579964); return false;\"><img alt=\"TrailmixNCocoa\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7579964&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334085\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7579964)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/trailmixncocoa\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7579964); return false;\">TrailmixNCocoa</a></span><br/>\nA <span style=\"color: #ebaa0a\">SchulzeNCocoa</span> Collab</p><br><p><em>Objectcon Exempted</em></p><br><p><span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/trailmixncocoa\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7579964); return false;\"><img alt=\"TrailmixNCocoa\" class=\"small\" src=\"http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=7579964&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1730334085\" style=\"background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=7579964)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/trailmixncocoa\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(7579964); return false;\">TrailmixNCocoa</a></span> for the original idea.</p><br><p>Hyrum Lantern Instance - <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/48310948@N03/4801687932\">\"Lantern\"</a> by <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/48310948@N03/\">Juhana Leinonen</a> released under <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\">CC BY 2.0</a>.</p><br><p>\u00ab <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/object-215\">Object 215</a> | Object 216 | <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/object-217\">Object 217</a> \u00bb</p><br><p>Cite this page as:</p><br><p>\"<a href=\"/object-216\">Object 216 - \"Hyrum Lanterns\"</a>\" by TrailmixNCocoa, from the <a href=\"https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com\">Backrooms Wiki</a>.
